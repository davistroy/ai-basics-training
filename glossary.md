# AI Practitioner Training Glossary

## A

**Agent** - An AI system that can autonomously perform multi-step tasks, make decisions, and interact with external tools without human intervention at each step.

**ASK-CONTEXT-CONSTRAINTS-EXAMPLE Framework** - Block 1 prompting methodology. ASK = clear request, CONTEXT = background information, CONSTRAINTS = limitations/requirements, EXAMPLE = desired output format.

## C

**Capstone** - End-of-block project demonstrating mastery of block skills. Required for certification.

**Checkpoint** - Inter-block assessment verifying readiness to proceed.

## D

**Domain Memory** - Structured external memory for AI agents consisting of three pillars: Explicit Goals, Progress Records, and Operating Procedures.

## L

**LLM-as-Judge Pattern** - Quality evaluation technique where an AI evaluates another AI's output against defined criteria.

## M

**MCP (Model Context Protocol)** - Protocol enabling AI assistants like Claude to access external resources (files, databases, APIs) through configured servers.

**Micro-Agent Pattern** - Design pattern using small, focused agents (3-20 steps) within deterministic workflows.

## O

**Orchestration** - Coordination of multiple agents or workflow steps to accomplish complex tasks.

## Q

**Quality Gate** - Automated checkpoint in a workflow that evaluates output quality before proceeding.

**Quality Rubric** - Structured evaluation criteria with defined scoring (typically 1-5 scale).

## T

**Two-Agent Pattern** - Core Block 3 architecture using an Executor agent (performs tasks) and Evaluator agent (assesses quality).

## W

**Workflow** - Multi-step automated process connecting AI operations with triggers, conditions, and outputs.
