1. Welcome participants
2. Quick status check on workflows
3. Set the capstone preparation mindset
4. Preview today's focus

**Opening Script:**
> "Welcome to Week 7 - Capstone Preparation. We're in the home stretch. Today we review exactly what's required for your Block 2 capstone, calculate real impact from your workflows, and prepare your portfolio. Next week is evaluation. Let's make sure you're ready."

**Engagement Opportunity:**
> "Quick status check - by show of hands: Who has all three workflows working? [Count] Who has at least two? [Count] Who needs support to get caught up? [Note names]"

---

### Segment 1: Capstone Requirements Review (10 minutes)

**Learning Objective:** Understand all capstone components and evaluation criteria

**Slides:** 4-7

#### Content Delivery

**Key Point 1: Required Components (5 deliverables)**
1. 3 Workflow Templates - Documented, tested, integrated
2. Quality System - Evaluation prompts, rubrics, gates
3. MCP Demonstration - Functional integration
4. Performance Documentation - Metrics, logs, analysis
5. Impact Measurement - Real data, ROI calculation

**Key Point 2: Evaluation Criteria (8 dimensions)**
Walk through each criterion briefly:
1. Workflow Design (5 pts) - Architecture, error handling
2. Integration Quality (5 pts) - Component connections
3. MCP Implementation (5 pts) - Functional MCP use
4. Quality Systems (5 pts) - LLM-as-judge, rubrics
5. Performance Monitoring (5 pts) - Logging, metrics
6. Documentation Completeness (5 pts) - All required docs
7. Practical Application (5 pts) - Real use cases
8. Overall Toolkit Value (5 pts) - Holistic assessment

> "That's 40 points maximum. 32+ is excellent, 28-31 is proficient, 24-27 is developing. Below 24 needs additional work."

**Key Point 3: Self-Evaluation**
- Week 8 is self-evaluation week
- You'll score yourself on all 8 criteria
- Must include evidence for each score
- Honest self-assessment is the goal

#### Facilitation Notes

**Watch For:**
- Panic about incomplete work
- Confusion about requirements
- Underestimating documentation needs

**If Participants Are Behind:**
> "If you're not caught up, that's your focus for homework. Reach out for support. It's better to have fewer polished workflows than three incomplete ones."

**Transition to Segment 2:**
> "Now let's talk about impact - how to calculate the real value of what you've built."

### Segment 2: Impact Measurement with Real Data (15 minutes)

**Learning Objective:** Calculate actual ROI from workflow executions

**Slides:** 8-11

#### Content Delivery

**Key Point 1: Why Real Data Matters**
- Projections are guesses, actuals are proof
- Real data tells the story to stakeholders
- Even small samples provide valuable insights
- This becomes your business case for AI

**Key Point 2: Data to Collect**
Walk through what to pull from execution logs:
- Execution timestamps and durations
- Success/failure rates
- Quality scores
- Human review rates
- API costs

**Key Point 3: Calculation Framework**
Walk through the calculation live:

```
Time Savings Calculation:
- Manual process time (Block 1 baseline): 45 min
- Automated process time: 5 min
- Savings per execution: 40 min
- Number of executions: 25
- Total time saved: 25 × 40 = 1000 min = 16.7 hours

Cost Analysis:
- AI API costs: $3.50
- Platform costs: $0 (free tier)
- Total cost: $3.50

Value Calculation:
- Time saved: 16.7 hours
- Value at $150/hr: $2,505
- Cost: $3.50
- Net value: $2,501.50
- ROI: $2,501.50 / $3.50 = 71,471%
```

**Key Point 4: Annual Projection**
- Current execution rate (e.g., 25 per month)
- Annualized: 25 × 12 = 300 executions
- Annual time saved: 300 × 40 min = 200 hours
- Annual value: $30,000
- Team scale: multiply by number of potential users

#### Demo: Live Calculation

Use real or realistic numbers. Walk through:
1. Pull execution count from platform
2. Calculate average execution time
3. Compare to manual baseline
4. Apply cost assumptions
5. Show ROI result

**Demo Talking Points:**
> "Notice we're using actual numbers, not projections. Even if your sample is small, it's real data."

> "The ROI looks impressive because knowledge work is expensive. This is why AI automation is so valuable."

## Anticipated Questions & Answers

### Conceptual Questions

**Q: What if I don't have 20+ executions logged?**
A: Use what you have. Even 10 executions provide valuable data. The point is using real numbers, not the quantity. Focus on making your calculations accurate for your sample size.

**Q: How honest should I be in self-evaluation?**
A: Completely honest. The goal is accurate self-assessment, not maximum scores. Evidence should support your ratings. Inflated scores without evidence are obvious.

### Technical Questions

**Q: How do I calculate time saved if I didn't track manual time?**
A: Estimate the manual process time based on your Block 1 experience. Document your estimation method. Even an informed estimate is valuable.

**Q: What if one workflow isn't working well?**
A: Focus on quality over quantity. Two excellent workflows are better than three incomplete ones. Document what you learned from the struggling workflow.

### Scope Questions

**Q: How much documentation is enough?**
A: Apply the handoff test: Could someone else set up and maintain your system? If yes, you have enough. If no, add more detail.

**Q: What happens if I don't complete the capstone?**
A: You can continue working and submit when ready. Block 3 enrollment requires Block 2 completion, so completing the capstone is essential for progression.
