## SLIDE 4: THE AUTOMATION MATURITY PROGRESSION

**Title:** Your AI Maturity Journey

**Content:**

```
LEVEL 1: Templates          ← Block 1 (COMPLETED)
         ↓
LEVEL 2: Workflows          ← Block 2 (STARTING NOW)
         ↓
LEVEL 3: Agents             ← Block 3 (FUTURE)
         ↓
LEVEL 4: Orchestration      (Advanced)
```

**Key Shift:** From manual prompting to automated execution

**Graphic:** Staircase or pyramid visual showing progression, with Level 2 highlighted in orange

**SPEAKER NOTES:**

"[Hook - Create context]"

"Let me show you where you are and where you're going.

In Block 1, you reached Level 1 - you have templated workflows. You created prompt templates that produce consistent results when YOU run them.

Now in Block 2, we're moving to Level 2 - workflow engineering. Instead of YOU running the prompts, you'll build SYSTEMS that run them automatically.

Block 3 will take you to Level 3 - agent architecture - where AI systems can make decisions and take actions with minimal human intervention.

[Point to graphic]

Notice the key shift happening right now: from manual prompting to automated execution. This is a significant mindset change.

In Block 1, you were the operator. In Block 2, you become the engineer who designs systems that operate themselves."

[Transition]

## SLIDE 5: WHAT YOU BUILT IN BLOCK 1

**Title:** Your Block 1 Foundation

**Content:**

**Assets You Created:**
- Prompt Library (3+ documented templates)
- style.json (voice and style specifications)
- Quality Rubrics (evaluation criteria)
- GitHub Repository (organized structure)

**How They Become Block 2 Inputs:**

| Block 1 Asset | Block 2 Use |
|---------------|-------------|
| Prompt Templates | AI processing steps in workflows |
| style.json | Automated style checking |
| Quality Rubrics | Automated quality gates |
| Repository | MCP integration source |

**Graphic:** Flow diagram showing Block 1 outputs feeding into Block 2 workflow

**SPEAKER NOTES:**

"Everything you built in Block 1 becomes input for Block 2.

[Point to table]

Your prompt templates become the AI processing steps in your automated workflows.

Your style.json becomes the reference for automated style checking - the workflow can verify outputs match your voice without you reviewing each one.

Your quality rubrics become automated quality gates - the system evaluates outputs against your criteria and routes them appropriately.

And your GitHub repository becomes accessible via MCP - Claude can read your templates directly from GitHub without copy-paste.

See how this builds? You're not starting over. You're leveraging everything you've already created."

## SLIDE 7: SEGMENT 1 SUMMARY

**Title:** Block 2 Context

**Content:**

**Key Takeaways:**
- You're moving from prompt operator to workflow engineer
- Block 1 assets become Block 2 inputs
- Capstone: 3 workflows + MCP + metrics + impact

**The Mindset Shift:**
> "I run prompts" → "I design systems that run prompts"

**What's Next:**
- Platform selection to build these workflows
- MCP understanding for powerful integrations

**Graphic:** Simple transformation arrow from "Manual" to "Automated"

**SPEAKER NOTES:**

"Before we move on, let me summarize:

You're making a significant shift - from being the person who runs prompts to the engineer who designs systems that run them.

Everything you built in Block 1 transfers directly. Your templates, your style guide, your rubrics - they all become components of your automated workflows.

And your capstone will be a real, working toolkit - not theoretical but actually processing your work.

[Pause]

Now let's talk about the platforms that make this possible."

## SLIDE 8: THE AUTOMATION EVOLUTION

**Title:** From Manual to Automated

**Content:**

```
MANUAL     →    TEMPLATES    →    WORKFLOWS    →    AGENTS
   ↑              ↑                  ↑               ↑
One-off      Consistent         Automated       Autonomous
prompts      structure          execution        decisions
```

**Today's Focus: The Workflow Layer**

**Graphic:** Horizontal timeline with "Workflows" highlighted and expanded

**SPEAKER NOTES:**

"[Hook - The evolution]"

"Let's look at how automation evolves.

We start with manual - one-off prompts, each time starting from scratch.

Then templates - Block 1 - where we have consistent structure but still manual execution.

Now workflows - Block 2 - where execution happens automatically when triggered.

Eventually agents - Block 3 - where the AI makes decisions and takes actions autonomously.

[Point to Workflows]

Our focus right now is this middle layer. Workflows are the foundation for everything that comes after. You can't build reliable agents without reliable workflows.

To build workflows, we need platforms. Let's look at the landscape."

[Transition]

## SLIDE 9: PLATFORM CATEGORIES

**Title:** Four Types of Automation Platforms

**Content:**

| Category | Examples | Best For | AI Integration |
|----------|----------|----------|----------------|
| **No-Code** | Make, Zapier, Power Automate | Business users, quick setup | Good |
| **Low-Code** | n8n, Pipedream, Retool | Technical comfort, more control | Very Good |
| **AI-Native** | Claude MCP, LangChain | Deep AI focus | Excellent |
| **Enterprise** | UiPath, Automation Anywhere | Large scale, governance | Variable |

**Recommendation:** Start with Make or n8n for most consultants

**Graphic:** Four quadrant diagram with learning curve on one axis, AI capability on another

**SPEAKER NOTES:**

"There are four main categories of automation platforms.

[Point to No-Code]
No-code platforms like Make, Zapier, and Power Automate are designed for business users. Drag-and-drop interfaces, quick setup, good AI integration. If you've never automated before, this is often the best starting point.

[Point to Low-Code]
Low-code platforms like n8n and Pipedream offer more control. You can do more complex things, but there's a slightly steeper learning curve. Great if you have some technical comfort.

[Point to AI-Native]
AI-native platforms are built specifically around AI capabilities. MCP falls here. Excellent for deep AI integration but often require more technical skill.

[Point to Enterprise]
Enterprise platforms like UiPath are designed for large organizations with governance requirements. Usually overkill for individual consultants.

For most of you, I recommend starting with Make or n8n. Both have excellent AI integration, manageable learning curves, and free tiers good enough for our work."

[Transition]

## SLIDE 10: KEY SELECTION CRITERIA

**Title:** What to Consider When Choosing

**Content:**

| Criterion | Why It Matters | Weight |
|-----------|----------------|--------|
| **Learning Curve** | You need to be productive quickly | 20% |
| **AI Integration** | This is an AI workflow course! | 25% |
| **Cost** | Budget constraints are real | 15% |
| **Collaboration** | Team rollout potential | 15% |
| **Security** | Client data handling | 15% |
| **Scalability** | Growth potential | 10% |

**Graphic:** Pie chart showing the weight distribution of criteria

**SPEAKER NOTES:**

"When you're comparing platforms, here are the six criteria that matter most.

[Walk through each]

Learning curve gets 20% weight because you need to be productive quickly. Block 2 only lasts 8 weeks.

AI integration is our highest weight at 25% - this is an AI workflow course, after all. How deeply can the platform work with Claude, GPT, and other AI systems?

Cost at 15% - we want platforms with usable free tiers. Don't pay money during the learning phase.

Collaboration at 15% - even if you're working alone now, you may want to share these workflows with your team later.

Security at 15% - you'll be processing client data. The platform needs appropriate data handling capabilities.

Scalability at 10% - less urgent for learning, but nice to know you can grow.

In a moment, I'll show you how to use these in a decision matrix."

[Transition]

## SLIDE 11: DATA HANDLING AWARENESS

**Title:** Before You Automate: Know Your Data Flows

**Content:**

**Key Principles:**

1. **Know your data flows**
   - What data passes through each platform?
   - What touches the AI provider?

2. **Check retention policies**
   - How long is data kept?
   - Who has access?

3. **Client obligations first**
   - Review contracts before automating
   - Document your choices

4. **When in doubt, anonymize**
   - Use placeholder data for testing
   - Sanitize sensitive fields

**This isn't fear - it's professional awareness**

**Graphic:** Data flow diagram showing data path through platform and AI

**SPEAKER NOTES:**

"Before we dive into platform selection, a critical point about data handling.

When you automate workflows that process client or sensitive data, you need to understand where that data goes.

[Point to each principle]

First, know your data flows. Every platform and AI service handles data differently. Understand what passes through.

Second, check retention policies. Most AI providers retain data temporarily - know the specifics.

Third, put client obligations first. Before you automate anything with client data, review your contracts.

Fourth, when in doubt, anonymize. Use placeholder data for testing. Sanitize sensitive fields.

[Pause]

This isn't about being scared of automation. It's about being a professional who understands their tools.

Document your choices. Know what goes where. That's it."

[Transition]

## SLIDE 12: SEGMENT 2 SUMMARY

**Title:** Platform Landscape Takeaways

**Content:**

**Remember:**
- Four categories: No-code, Low-code, AI-native, Enterprise
- Match platform to your skills and needs
- Start with Make or n8n for best balance
- AI integration is highest priority criterion
- Know your data flows before automating

**You'll Practice:**
- Exercise 1.1: Complete decision matrix for 2-3 platforms
- Create account on selected platform
- Complete getting started tutorial

**Graphic:** Simple decision tree: "Need quick start?" → Make, "Want more control?" → n8n

**SPEAKER NOTES:**

"Let me summarize the platform landscape:

Four categories exist, but for most consultants, the no-code and low-code options make the most sense.

Make is easiest to learn with good AI integration. n8n offers more power with a bit more complexity.

AI integration is our highest priority - weight it at 25% in your decision.

And always understand your data flows before processing anything sensitive.

In your homework, you'll complete a decision matrix for 2-3 platforms, create an account, and finish the getting started tutorial.

Now let me show you how to make this decision systematically."

## SLIDE 13: THE DECISION MATRIX FRAMEWORK

**Title:** Systematic Platform Selection

**Content:**

| Criterion | Weight | Platform A | Platform B | Platform C |
|-----------|--------|------------|------------|------------|
| Learning Curve | 20% | ? | ? | ? |
| AI Integration | 25% | ? | ? | ? |
| Cost | 15% | ? | ? | ? |
| Collaboration | 15% | ? | ? | ? |
| Security | 15% | ? | ? | ? |
| Scalability | 10% | ? | ? | ? |
| **Weighted Total** | 100% | ? | ? | ? |

**Scoring:** 1-5 for each criterion (5 = best)

**Graphic:** Empty matrix template ready to be filled in

**SPEAKER NOTES:**

"[INSIGHT - The framework]"

"Here's the decision matrix you'll complete in your homework.

For each criterion, you'll score each platform from 1 to 5. Five is best - easiest to learn, best AI integration, lowest cost, etc.

Then you multiply each score by its weight and sum them up.

[Point to weights]

Notice the weights we discussed: AI integration at 25%, learning curve at 20%, the others at 15% each, and scalability at 10%.

This gives you a numerical comparison. Instead of 'which one feels right?' you have 'which one scores highest?'

Let me show you how scoring works."

[Transition]

## SLIDE 14: SCORING GUIDE

**Title:** How to Score Each Criterion

**Content:**

**Scoring Scale (1-5):**

| Score | Meaning | Example for Learning Curve |
|-------|---------|---------------------------|
| 5 | Excellent | Built first workflow in under 30 minutes |
| 4 | Good | Completed tutorial in one sitting |
| 3 | Adequate | Needed some external help |
| 2 | Poor | Struggled significantly |
| 1 | Missing | Couldn't figure it out |

**Where to Find Information:**
- Learning Curve: Platform tutorials, user reviews
- AI Integration: Documentation, feature lists
- Cost: Pricing pages, free tier limits
- Collaboration: Feature lists
- Security: Security documentation, compliance pages
- Scalability: Pricing tiers, enterprise options

**Graphic:** Thermometer or gauge visual showing the 1-5 scale

**SPEAKER NOTES:**

"Here's how to score each criterion.

[Point to scale]

5 means excellent - the best you could hope for. For learning curve, that means you built your first workflow in under 30 minutes.

4 is good - above average. You completed the tutorial without major issues.

3 is adequate - average, needed some help.

2 is poor - you struggled significantly.

1 means missing or unacceptable.

[Point to information sources]

Where do you find this information? For learning curve, actually try the tutorials. For AI integration, check their documentation. For cost, look at pricing pages. And so on.

This should take about 20-25 minutes of research to complete for 2-3 platforms."

[Transition]

| First workflow | Can build in ~30 min |
| Documentation | Extensive with videos |
| Community | Large, active forums |

**What score would you give? 1-5?**

**Graphic:** Screenshot of Make interface or tutorial

**SPEAKER NOTES:**

"[Interactive - Group exercise]"

"Let's practice this together. We'll score Make on Learning Curve.

[If anyone has tried Make]

Has anyone here tried Make? What was your experience with getting started?

[Collect 2-3 responses]

[If no one has tried it, walk through factors]

Let me share what I know:
- Make has a guided onboarding tutorial
- Most people build their first workflow in about 30 minutes
- Documentation is extensive with video guides
- There's a large, active community

Based on that, what score would you give? Shout out a number.

[Collect responses]

Most people say 4 or 5. I'd give it a 4.5, which I'd round to 5 for the matrix.

This is how you'll evaluate each criterion for each platform. You're doing this for 2-3 platforms across 6 criteria in your homework."

[Transition]

## SLIDE 16: SEGMENT 3 SUMMARY

**Title:** Making Your Decision

**Content:**

**The Process:**
1. Research 2-3 platforms (your category)
2. Score each on 6 criteria (1-5)
3. Calculate weighted totals
4. Select highest scorer (or close)
5. Create account
6. Complete getting started tutorial

**If Still Stuck:**
- Default to Make (lowest barrier)
- Skills transfer between platforms
- You can switch later if needed

**Deliverable:** `platform-decision-matrix.md`

**Graphic:** Flowchart showing the 6-step process

**SPEAKER NOTES:**

"Here's your decision process in six steps:

Research 2-3 platforms - focus on your category (no-code or low-code for most of you).

Score each on the 6 criteria we discussed.

Calculate weighted totals - multiply score by weight, sum them up.

Select the highest scorer - or very close if you have strong personal preference.

Create an account on that platform.

And complete their getting started tutorial before next week.

[Pause]

If you're still stuck after the matrix, just pick Make. It has the lowest barrier to entry, and the skills transfer. You can always switch later.

The goal is to have a working platform for Week 2 when we build actual workflows.

Questions on the decision process?

[Take 1-2 questions if time]

Now let's talk about MCP - the technology that makes AI workflows truly powerful."

## SLIDE 17: MCP - "USB-C FOR AI"

**Title:** Model Context Protocol (MCP)

**Content:**

**The Analogy:**
- USB-C: Universal connector for devices
- MCP: Universal protocol for AI tools

**What MCP Enables:**
- Claude reading your local files
- Claude accessing your GitHub repositories
- Claude connecting to databases, APIs, services
- All without custom coding

**Graphic:** Visual showing Claude in center with MCP connections radiating to various tools (files, GitHub, Slack, databases)

**SPEAKER NOTES:**

"[Hook - The game changer]"

"Now let me introduce MCP - the Model Context Protocol. This is what makes AI workflows truly powerful.

Think of it like USB-C. Before USB-C, you needed different cables for different devices. USB-C standardized everything - one connector works with anything.

MCP does the same for AI. Instead of building custom integrations for each tool you want Claude to use, MCP provides a standard protocol. If a tool has an MCP server, Claude can connect to it.

[Point to graphic]

This means Claude can read your local files directly. Access your GitHub repositories. Connect to databases, APIs, Slack - all through the same standardized protocol.

No custom coding required. You configure, not code."

│    (Capability)     │
└─────────────────────┘
```

**Components:**
- **Host:** Claude Desktop (runs the AI)
- **Server:** Pre-built connector (handles communication)
- **Tools/Resources:** What the server provides access to

**Graphic:** Architecture diagram with labeled components

**SPEAKER NOTES:**

"Here's how MCP works architecturally.

[Point to Host]

At the top is the Host - that's Claude Desktop. This is where you interact with Claude.

[Point to Server]

In the middle is the MCP Server. This is a pre-built connector that bridges Claude to external capabilities. You don't build these - you configure them.

[Point to Tool]

At the bottom is the external tool - your files, GitHub, Slack, a database - whatever the server connects to.

The MCP protocol is the standardized communication between these layers.

What this means for you: instead of figuring out how to connect Claude to your tools, you install a pre-built server and configure it. The server handles all the technical details."

[Transition]

## SLIDE 19: MCP SERVER REGISTRY

**Title:** Pre-Built Servers Ready to Use

**Content:**

**Official Servers (Anthropic-maintained):**
- `filesystem` - Read/write local files
- `github` - Repository operations
- `slack` - Workspace integration
- `postgres`/`sqlite` - Database access

**Community Servers:**
- Google Drive
- Notion
- Jira
- Custom tools

**Registry:** github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers

**Graphic:** Screenshot of MCP Server Registry or grid of server icons

**SPEAKER NOTES:**

"There's already an ecosystem of MCP servers you can use.

[Point to Official]

Official servers are maintained by Anthropic. Filesystem lets Claude read and write your local files. GitHub gives access to your repositories. Slack connects to your workspace. Database servers connect to Postgres or SQLite.

[Point to Community]

Community servers extend this further - Google Drive, Notion, Jira, and many more.

[Point to registry]

All of these are available in the MCP Server Registry on GitHub.

In your homework, you'll explore this registry and identify which servers are relevant to YOUR work. We'll actually configure them in Week 5."

**Graphic:** Placeholder for live demo or screenshot backup

**SPEAKER NOTES:**

"[DEMO - Show, don't tell]"

"Let me show you the registry.

[Navigate to github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers]

This is the MCP Server Registry. You can see the list of available servers.

[Click into filesystem server]

The filesystem server lets Claude read and write files in directories you specify. Notice the documentation - it tells you exactly what it can do and how to configure it.

[Click into GitHub server]

The GitHub server gives Claude access to your repositories. It can read files, list contents, even create or update files. You'd use this to let Claude access your prompt library directly.

[If time, show one more server]

In Exercise 1.2, you'll explore this registry and identify 5-10 servers relevant to your work.

Before MCP works, you need Claude Desktop installed. That's also in your homework."

Exercise 1.1 is the big one - 25 minutes to research platforms, complete your decision matrix, create your account, and do the getting started tutorial. This is critical - you need a working platform for Week 2.

Exercise 1.2 takes 20 minutes to explore the MCP registry. Identify 5-10 servers relevant to your work and document your top 3 in detail.

Exercise 1.3 is 15 minutes to define performance metrics for the workflow you'll build. We want to measure from day one.

[Emphasize]

The critical item is creating your platform account and completing the tutorial. Without that, you can't build in Week 2."
