## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### "I can't access Claude/ChatGPT from my work network"
Contact IT to request access, explaining this is for professional development in AI skills. If blocked, you may need to complete exercises from a personal device or network.

### "I've never used GitHub"
That's okay! Block 1 Week 3 teaches GitHub basics. Just create the account beforehand.

### "I'm not technical"
This curriculum is designed for consultants, not developers. The technical concepts are introduced gradually with clear explanations. Focus on the business applications.

### "I don't have time for homework"
Weekly commitment is approximately 2 hours (45 min live + 60-75 min self-paced). Consider blocking this time on your calendar. The skills compound—skipping exercises makes later weeks harder.
