## Session Delivery Guide

### Opening (5 minutes)

**Opening Script:**
> "Welcome to Week 7. We're in the final preparation phase now.
>
> Last week you organized your library. This week is about completion - making sure you have everything needed for the Block 1 capstone.
>
> Week 8 is evaluation week. There's no live workshop. You'll submit your capstone and complete a self-evaluation. So today is our last instructional session for Block 1.
>
> Let's make sure you're ready."

### Segment 1: Capstone Requirements Review (10 minutes)

**Key Point 1: What's Required**
- Organized GitHub Repository
- 5+ Prompt Templates (documented, tested)
- style.json (personal style configuration)
- Quality Rubrics (at least 2)
- Task Priority Matrix

**Key Point 2: Evaluation Criteria (6 dimensions)**
1. Template Quality & Documentation
2. Variety & Coverage
3. style.json Sophistication
4. Quality System Implementation
5. Repository Organization
6. Practical Application

**Key Point 3: Passing Score**
- Total: 30 points (6 x 5)
- Passing: 18 points (60%)
- Levels: Excellent (26+), Good (22-25), Adequate (18-21)

**Facilitation Notes:**
> "Look at your repository right now. Do you have all five components? Be honest with yourself - there's still time to complete gaps."

---

### Segment 2: Template Completion Checklist (10 minutes)

**Key Point 1: What Each Template Needs**
- Metadata header (title, category, tags, version)
- Purpose section
- When to use section
- Template with marked variables
- Variable descriptions table
- Real example (input and output)
- Tips section
- Quality rubric reference

**Key Point 2: Quality Check Questions**
- Is the purpose clear?
- Are variables explained?
- Is there a real example?
- Is it linked to a quality rubric?
- Has it been tested with AI?

**Key Point 3: Minimum Count**
- 5 templates required
- Variety encouraged (different deliverable types)
- Quality > Quantity

---

### Segment 3: Task Priority Matrix (12 minutes)

**Key Point 1: What Is It**
- Analysis of your AI automation opportunities
- Maps tasks by frequency and time impact
- Identifies where to focus efforts

**Key Point 2: The Matrix Structure**
- Frequency (1-5): How often do you do this?
- Time Impact (1-5): How long does it take?
- Score = Frequency x Time
- Template status: Do you have a template?

**Key Point 3: Four Quadrants**
- High Frequency + High Time = Automate First
- High Frequency + Low Time = Quick Wins
- Low Frequency + High Time = Worth Automating
- Low Frequency + Low Time = Optional

**Key Point 4: Block 2 Connection**
> "Your high-scoring tasks without templates are Block 2 candidates. Complex tasks that need workflow automation, not just prompts."

---

### Segment 4: style.json Finalization + Close (8 minutes)

**Key Point 1: Review Requirements**
- Voice configuration
- Writing preferences
- Use/avoid lists
- Domain-specific settings
- Tested with multiple prompts

**Key Point 2: Final Preparation**
- Complete any gaps this week
- Self-evaluate using the rubric
- Prepare capstone summary

**Homework Preview:**
> "Four exercises this week - all focused on capstone preparation:
> - Exercise 7.1: Complete template documentation
> - Exercise 7.2: Create task priority matrix
> - Exercise 7.3: Finalize style.json
> - Exercise 7.4: Repository final review
>
> Week 8 is self-evaluation. No live workshop. Submit your capstone and complete the evaluation form."

## Anticipated Questions & Answers

**Q: What if I don't have 5 templates?**
A: You have this week to create more. Focus on templates you'll actually use. One well-documented template is better than three empty ones.

**Q: Can I use templates I created before this program?**
A: Yes, if you update them to meet the requirements - metadata, documentation, examples, quality rubric connection.

**Q: What if I don't pass?**
A: You can resubmit after addressing gaps. Focus on understanding the feedback and improving specific areas.

**Q: How much does the task matrix matter?**
A: It's one of six criteria. It shows strategic thinking about AI automation. A thoughtful matrix demonstrates you're not just making templates, but thinking about where AI adds value.
