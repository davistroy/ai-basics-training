### Segment 2: Team Rollout Planning (12 minutes)

**Learning Objective:** Create realistic deployment plan for team use

**Slides:** 8-13

#### Content Delivery

**Key Point 1: Rollout Considerations**
- Main message: Think about real-world deployment
- Questions to answer: Who uses it? What access? How triggered? What training? How report issues?
- Key insight: "An agent only delivers value when people actually use it"

**Key Point 2: Three-Phase Rollout**
- Main message: Phased approach reduces risk
- Phases:
  - Phase 1: Pilot (1-2 users) - Test, gather feedback, fix issues
  - Phase 2: Expand (5-10 users) - Broader testing, refine docs, build confidence
  - Phase 3: Full Deploy - All users, self-service, standard support
- Key insight: "Each phase has explicit success criteria before moving forward"

**Key Point 3: Training and Support**
- Main message: Users need help to succeed
- Training elements: User guide, quick start, FAQ, escalation process
- Key insight: "Don't assume users will figure it out - make success easy"

---

### Segment 3: ROI Calculation with Real Data (13 minutes)

**Learning Objective:** Calculate compelling business case with actual metrics

**Slides:** 14-19

#### Content Delivery

**Key Point 1: Collecting Actual Metrics**
- Main message: Use real data from your executions
- Sources: 30+ executions, time tracking, quality scores, cost logs
- Key insight: "Projections are nice; actual data is compelling"

**Key Point 2: ROI Framework Components**
- Main message: Four value areas plus costs
- Value areas:
  - Time Savings: Manual time - Agent time = Savings per task
  - Quality Improvement: Error reduction, rework reduction
  - Capacity Expansion: Can handle more work
- Costs: API costs, platform costs, development investment, maintenance
- Key insight: "Be honest about costs - credibility matters"

**Key Point 3: Net ROI and Payback**
- Main message: Calculate net monthly benefit and payback period
- Formula: Monthly value - Monthly cost = Net benefit
- Payback: Development cost / Monthly net benefit = Months
- Team scale: Show what happens with 5-10 users
- Key insight: "Strong ROI makes deployment decisions easy"

>
> Exercise 7.2 is Create Team Rollout Plan - 25 minutes. Plan realistic deployment for team use with phases, training, and support.
>
> Exercise 7.3 is Calculate Final ROI - 25 minutes. Document actual business impact with real data from your executions.
>

## Anticipated Questions & Answers

### Conceptual Questions

**Q: What if I don't have 30+ executions?**
A: Run more before Week 8. You need real data for credible ROI. Even 20 executions is better than projections.

**Q: How detailed should the rollout plan be?**
A: Detailed enough that someone could actually follow it. Include specific names if possible, concrete timelines, and realistic success criteria.

**Q: What's the most important criterion?**
A: They're all important, but Business Impact often differentiates good from excellent. Showing actual value generated makes everything else more compelling.

### Technical Questions

**Q: How do I calculate hourly rate for ROI?**
A: Use loaded cost if available, otherwise estimate (often $50-100/hour for professional roles). Be consistent and document your assumptions.

**Q: Can I include development time as a cost?**
A: Yes, include it as one-time investment. Then show how monthly savings pay back that investment.

## Week-Specific Notes

### What Makes This Week Unique

- **Final preparation** - Last chance to fill gaps before evaluation
- **Business focus** - ROI and deployment planning
- **Synthesis** - Bringing all pieces together into cohesive capstone
- **High stakes** - Certification depends on this week's preparation

### Dependencies

**Builds On:**
- Week 6: Optimized, monitored system ready for documentation
- Weeks 1-5: All technical components implemented

**Sets Up:**
- Week 8: Self-paced evaluation and certification

### Critical Success Factors

1. **Complete documentation** - No gaps in critical areas
2. **Real data** - Actual metrics from 30+ executions
3. **Realistic rollout** - Plans that could actually work
4. **Compelling ROI** - Clear business value demonstrated

## Quick Reference Cards

### Key Messages to Emphasize

1. "Real data is more compelling than projections"
2. "Phased rollout reduces risk"
3. "Documentation enables others to use what you built"

### If You Only Have Time For One Thing

Have participants run their agent systems to collect real metrics. Everything else in the capstone depends on actual data.

### Red Flags to Watch For

- Participant hasn't run agent in over a week
- Documentation only exists in their head
- ROI based entirely on projections
- No consideration of team deployment
