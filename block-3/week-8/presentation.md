## Slide 14: Self-Evaluation Tips

### Be Honest With Yourself

**Questions to consider:**

1. Would I trust this to run unsupervised?
2. Can I prove the business value with data?
3. Could someone else use this from my documentation?
4. What's the biggest remaining risk?
5. What would I do differently with more time?

**Inflated self-evaluations don't help you learn.**
