In our third segment, [describe Segment 3 and its importance].

And we'll close with [Segment 4] before previewing your homework.

[Pause]

Any questions before we dive in?"

[Transition]

Notice that these are all ACTION-focused. This isn't about knowing concepts - it's about DOING things. You'll practice each of these in your homework exercises.

[Point to first objective]

This one connects directly to [how it builds on previous learning or applies to real work].

Let's get started."

[Transition: Click to Segment 1]

**BACKGROUND:**

**Rationale:**

**BACKGROUND:**

**Rationale:**
- Live demonstrations create concrete understanding that slides cannot
- Narrating actions while doing them reinforces learning
- "Watch for" points focus attention on key takeaways

**Demo Backup Plan:**
If live demo fails:
1. Use prepared screenshots showing each step
2. Walk through the process conceptually
