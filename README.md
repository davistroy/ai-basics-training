## Learning Approach

### Pedagogical Principles

- **Andragogy:** Self-directed, experience-based, goal-oriented adult learning
- **Experiential Learning:** Concrete experience → reflection → conceptualization → experimentation
- **80/20 Rule:** 80% hands-on practice, 20% theory
- **Scaffolded Progression:** Each block builds on the previous
- **Competency-Based Assessment:** Demonstrated skills through capstones, not tests

### Weekly Structure

Each week follows a consistent format:

1. **Entry Criteria** - Prerequisites for the week
2. **Workshop Content** (45 min) - Live instruction with demos
3. **Self-Paced Exercises** (60-75 min) - Hands-on practice with deliverables
4. **Exit Criteria** - Skills demonstrated by week's end
