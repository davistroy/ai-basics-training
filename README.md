## Supplementary Materials

### Agent Memory Meta-Framework Presentation

The [presentation.md](presentation.md) file contains a comprehensive 48-slide presentation on why AI agents fail and how to fix them through proper memory architecture. Key concepts include:

- **The Three Pillars of Domain Memory:** Explicit Goals, Progress Records, Operating Procedures
- **Micro-Agent Pattern:** Small, focused agents (3-20 steps) within deterministic workflows
- **Memory Lives in Structure, Not Agents:** External, structured memory for stateless agents

This content complements Block 3's agent architecture material and provides executive-level presentation material.

## Learning Approach

### Pedagogical Principles

- **Andragogy:** Self-directed, experience-based, goal-oriented adult learning
- **Experiential Learning:** Concrete experience → reflection → conceptualization → experimentation
- **80/20 Rule:** 80% hands-on practice, 20% theory
- **Scaffolded Progression:** Each block builds on the previous
- **Competency-Based Assessment:** Demonstrated skills through capstones, not tests

### Weekly Structure

Each week follows a consistent format:

1. **Entry Criteria** - Prerequisites for the week
2. **Workshop Content** (45 min) - Live instruction with demos
3. **Self-Paced Exercises** (60-75 min) - Hands-on practice with deliverables
4. **Exit Criteria** - Skills demonstrated by week's end
