# Block 1 Executive Summary: AI Prompting Mastery

## Transform How You Work with AI—No Coding Required

Block 1 is your gateway to becoming a recognized **AI Prompting Practitioner**—the first step toward systematically leveraging AI to deliver exceptional client value, faster and more consistently than ever before.

---

## Who This Is For

**This program is designed specifically for consulting professionals**—not software developers, not data scientists, not technical specialists.

If you:
- Write proposals, assessments, or client deliverables regularly
- Find yourself copying and pasting into ChatGPT or Claude without a system
- Know AI could help you work faster, but struggle to get consistent results
- Want to differentiate yourself as AI-fluent in client conversations

Then Block 1 is built for you.

**What You Don't Need:**
- No coding experience
- No technical background
- No prior AI training
- Just 2 hours per week and a willingness to learn

---

## The Problem Block 1 Solves

Most professionals use AI the same way: type something in, hope for the best, re-do it three times, and settle for "good enough."

That approach wastes time, produces inconsistent results, and treats every AI interaction as starting from zero.

**Block 1 changes that.**

You'll learn to engineer your prompts—not just write them—so that every interaction with AI produces reliable, professional-quality output. More importantly, you'll build a personal library of reusable templates that compound your efficiency over time.

---

## What You'll Walk Away With

| Deliverable | Value to You |
|-------------|--------------|
| **Personal Prompt Library** | A GitHub-hosted collection of your best prompts—searchable, organized, always available |
| **3+ Production-Ready Templates** | Fully documented templates for proposals, assessments, or other key deliverables you use weekly |
| **Quality Rubrics** | Clear 5-point scoring systems so AI outputs meet your standards every time |
| **Style Configuration** | A style.json file encoding your brand voice, formatting preferences, and professional standards |
| **AI Prompting Practitioner Certification** | Recognized credential demonstrating systematic AI competency |

## The Business Case: Your ROI

Let's be specific about the value:

```
Conservative Estimate:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Time saved per proposal using templates:     1.67 hours
Proposals per month:                         × 8
Months per year:                             × 12
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Annual hours recaptured:                     160 hours

At $150/hour billing rate:                   $24,000 value
Minus annual AI tool costs:                  - $360
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Net Annual ROI:                              $23,640+
```

And that's just proposals. Apply the same thinking to assessments, SOWs, client communications, and research—the multiplier effect grows substantially.

## Week-by-Week: What You'll Learn

### Week 1: The Foundation
**Structured Prompting & The ASK Framework**

Stop writing vague prompts that produce unpredictable results. Learn the **ASK-CONTEXT-CONSTRAINTS-EXAMPLE** framework—the four-section structure that turns every prompt into a reliable instruction set.

*You'll leave with:* Your first structured prompt and a prioritized list of your top 3 automation candidates.

---

### Week 2: Platform Mastery
**Advanced Prompting & Getting More from Your AI Tools**

Every AI platform has hidden capabilities most users never discover. Learn the **LLM-as-Judge pattern** (using AI to critique and improve its own output) and platform-specific optimizations for Claude, ChatGPT, and Copilot.

*You'll leave with:* The ability to iterate effectively, reduce costs, and get better results regardless of which AI tool you use.

---

### Week 3: Building Your System
**JSON Fundamentals & Version Control**

Transform your prompts from scattered notes into organized, shareable assets. Learn JSON for style configuration and GitHub basics for version control. Your prompts become **"promptware"**—company assets, not personal files that disappear when you switch laptops.

*You'll leave with:* Your style.json file and an initialized GitHub repository.

---

### Week 4: Consistent Quality
**Quality Rubrics & Workflow Design**

The difference between amateur and professional AI use: quality gates. Build 5-point rubrics with explicit criteria so you never again wonder "is this output good enough?"

*You'll leave with:* A comprehensive quality rubric for your primary deliverable type and the workflow logic to validate outputs.

---

### Week 5: Collaboration Ready
**GitHub Workflows & Documentation Standards**

Your templates are only valuable if others can use them—including future you. Learn branching, peer review, and professional documentation standards that make your work shareable across teams.

*You'll leave with:* A properly documented template and the skills to collaborate with colleagues on prompt development.

---

### Week 6: Organization at Scale
**Prompt Library Architecture**

Move from "I have some prompts somewhere" to a professionally organized, instantly navigable library. Learn folder taxonomies, naming conventions, and README hierarchies that scale.

*You'll leave with:* A complete repository structure with multi-level documentation.

---

### Week 7: Capstone Preparation
**Impact Estimation & Portfolio Assembly**

Prepare your final deliverables and quantify your impact. Learn the ROI calculation framework that demonstrates concrete value to leadership and clients.

*You'll leave with:* A complete impact estimation and final capstone preparation.

---

### Week 8: Capstone Evaluation
**Self-Paced Submission Week**

No live session—this week is for final polish and submission. Complete your self-evaluation, finalize your prompt library, and earn your AI Prompting Practitioner certification.

*You'll leave with:* Your certification and a production-ready prompt library.

---

## Why This Makes You More Valuable to Clients

Clients increasingly expect AI fluency from their consultants. But there's a vast difference between "I use ChatGPT sometimes" and "I have a systematic approach to AI-assisted delivery."

Block 1 graduates bring:

**Speed Without Sacrifice**
Deliver proposals in days, not weeks—without cutting corners on quality. Your templates encode best practices so every output meets professional standards automatically.

**Consistent Excellence**
Clients notice when deliverables vary wildly in quality. Your rubrics ensure every output hits the mark, building trust through reliability.

**Transparent Process**
When clients ask "how did you produce this so quickly?"—you have an answer. Your documented workflows demonstrate rigor, not shortcuts.

**Scalable Expertise**
Your prompt library becomes intellectual property you bring to every engagement. One well-crafted template serves dozens of clients.

**Future-Ready Positioning**
AI capabilities are expanding rapidly. Block 1 establishes the foundation for Blocks 2 and 3, where you'll learn workflow automation and autonomous agent architecture—skills that will define consulting's next decade.

## The Investment

| Commitment | Details |
|------------|---------|
| **Duration** | 8 weeks |
| **Weekly Time** | ~2 hours (45 min live session + 60-75 min homework) |
| **Format** | Interactive MS Teams workshops + hands-on exercises |
| **Prerequisites** | None—just basic computer skills and willingness to learn |
| **Outcome** | AI Prompting Practitioner certification + personal prompt library |

---

## What This Is NOT

Let's be clear about what Block 1 doesn't cover:

- **Not a coding bootcamp** — You won't write Python, JavaScript, or any programming language
- **Not AI/ML engineering** — We're not building models or training algorithms
- **Not a one-day workshop** — Real skill development requires practice over time
- **Not just theory** — 80% of your time is hands-on application

This is practical, applied training for professionals who want to use AI systematically without becoming technologists.

---

## The Path Forward

Block 1 is the foundation. But the journey continues:

```
Block 1: AI Prompting Practitioner
    ↓
Block 2: AI Workflow Engineer
    ↓ (Build automated multi-step workflows)
Block 3: AI Automation Architect
    ↓ (Design autonomous AI agents)
Advanced Modules (Optional)
    (Orchestration, reliability, advanced tooling)
```

Each block builds on the previous. By program completion, you'll architect AI systems that run complex workflows autonomously—a capability that transforms how consulting work gets done.

---

## Ready to Start?

The consultants who thrive in the next decade won't be those who avoid AI—they'll be those who mastered it systematically while others were still guessing.

Block 1 is where that mastery begins.

**Stop guessing. Start engineering your AI results.**
