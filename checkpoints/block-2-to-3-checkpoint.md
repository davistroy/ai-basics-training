# Block 2 → Block 3 Checkpoint Assessment

**Purpose:** Verify readiness for Block 3's agent complexity
**Time Required:** 45-60 minutes
**When:** After Block 2 capstone approval, before Block 3 Week 1

---

## Practical Skills Check

Complete this exercise to confirm Block 2 skills are solid:

### Task: Build a Mini-Workflow with Quality Gate

**Scenario:** Create a workflow that generates a client email draft and evaluates its quality.

**Requirements:**
1. Build a 3-step workflow in your automation platform:
   - Step 1: Accept input (client name, topic, tone)
   - Step 2: Generate email draft using AI
   - Step 3: Evaluate quality and route (pass → output, fail → flag)
2. Implement basic error handling
3. Log executions
4. Use MCP to access at least one resource (template or style guide)

### Deliverables

1. **Working workflow** (screenshot or export)
   - All 3 steps functional
   - Error handling visible
   - Logging configured

2. **Quality evaluation prompt** used in Step 3
   - At least 3 criteria
   - JSON output format
   - Clear pass/fail threshold

3. **Execution log** showing:
   - At least 3 successful runs
   - At least 1 quality gate rejection (test with bad input)
   - MCP tool usage visible

4. **MCP verification**
   - Screenshot of Claude recognizing your MCP servers
   - Demonstration of reading a file via MCP

## Gaps Identified

If you struggled with any part of this checkpoint:

| Gap Area | Remediation |
|----------|-------------|
| Workflow building | Review Block 2 Weeks 2-3 |
| Quality gates | Review Block 2 Week 3 |
| MCP configuration | Review Block 2 Weeks 5-6 + Appendix O |
| Error handling | Review Block 2 Week 2 |

---

## Block 3 Preparation

Before starting Block 3, also complete:

- [ ] Read [presentation.md](../archive/presentation.md) slides 1-25 (Domain Memory concepts)
- [ ] Identify your capstone agent candidate (complex workflow to convert)
- [ ] Review the Two-Agent Architecture Pattern overview
- [ ] Ensure MCP is working reliably (you'll depend on it heavily)

---

## Approval

- [ ] Checkpoint deliverables complete
- [ ] Self-assessment checklist complete
- [ ] Block 3 preparation items complete
- [ ] Any identified gaps addressed

**Ready for Block 3:** Yes / No

**Notes:**
[Space for facilitator feedback if reviewed]
