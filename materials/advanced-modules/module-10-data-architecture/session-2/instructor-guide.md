## Key Instructor Notes

### Session 1 Connection
- Reference participants' format selection designs from Exercise 1.2
- Show how those become transformation targets
- Acknowledge their semantic structuring work

### Critical Messages
1. "Transformation is systematic - use the six operations"
2. "Flag uncertainty, don't guess"
3. "Agent interfaces require complete context - no assumptions"
4. "Start with quick wins in AI readiness improvements"

### Capstone Guidance
- Exercise 2.3 is module capstone - emphasize its value
- 25 minutes is realistic if they use templates
- Encourage real data domain assessment (more valuable than generic)
- Remind: This becomes their blueprint for future projects

## Anticipated Questions & Answers

**Q: Should I transform all my legacy data at once?**
A: No - use the prioritization matrix. Start with quick wins and high-impact data. Full transformation can be phased.

**Q: How do I convince my team to adopt these patterns?**
A: Demonstrate value with one domain. Show before/after agent performance. Let success drive adoption.

**Q: What if transformation reveals data quality issues?**
A: That's actually valuable - now you know what to fix. Flag for review, don't try to fix in transformation layer.

**Q: Do agent interfaces need ALL that structure?**
A: Yes for reliability. You can start minimal and expand, but explicit context prevents failures.

## Quick Reference Cards

### If You Only Have Time For One Thing
The AI Readiness Assessment framework (Segment 4) - participants need this methodology to apply everything else they've learned.

### Key Analogies
| Concept | Analogy | When to Use |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| Transformation Pipeline | Assembly line - each stage adds value | Explaining the four stages |
| Agent Interfaces | API contracts - explicit, versioned, documented | Explaining why structure matters |
| AI Readiness | Health checkup - diagnose before treating | Motivating assessment |
