## Key Concepts

### Concept 1: PII Handling Framework

**Definition:**
Systematic approach to detecting, classifying, and protecting personally identifiable information throughout the AI system lifecycle (input, processing, output).

**Three-Stage Framework:**
1. **Input Stage:** Detect PII, classify sensitivity, apply handling rules
2. **Processing Stage:** Minimize PII in context, use references instead of values, apply masking
3. **Output Stage:** Scan for leakage, redact before display, audit trail, secure deletion

[Additional key concepts for data security, assessment methodology, red teaming, and multi-agent security follow]
