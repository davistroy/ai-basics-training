# **POWERPOINT PRESENTATION: MODULE 9 SESSION 2**
## **Security Assessment & Hardening**

**Module:** Advanced Module 9: AI Security Fundamentals
**Session:** 2 of 2
**Session Duration:** 45 minutes
**Delivery Format:** Live MS Teams workshop

**Target Audience:** Block 3 graduates completing AI security fundamentals training

**Key Thesis:** Comprehensive AI security requires systematic assessment methodologies, data protection frameworks, and multi-agent security architectures because security vulnerabilities compound across agent interactions, making defense-in-depth essential—where a single weak point in data handling, authentication, or communication protocols can compromise the entire autonomous system.

**Session Learning Objectives:** By the end of this session, participants will:
1. Implement PII handling and data security frameworks
2. Conduct systematic security assessments of AI systems
3. Apply red teaming basics to test AI defenses
4. Design secure multi-agent system architectures

**Entry Criteria:**
- [ ] Threat analysis completed (Exercise 1.1)
- [ ] Prompt injection defenses implemented (Exercise 1.2)
- [ ] Least privilege configuration applied (Exercise 1.3)

**Exit Criteria:**
- [ ] Data security controls implemented
- [ ] Security assessment methodology understood
- [ ] Module capstone (Security Assessment Report) completed

**Presentation Structure:**
1. Opening & Session 1 Review (3 min) - Slides 1-2
2. Segment 1: Data Security & PII Handling (12 min) - Slides 3-6
3. Segment 2: Security Assessment Methodology (12 min) - Slides 7-10
4. Segment 3: Red Teaming Basics (12 min) - Slides 11-14
5. Segment 4: Multi-Agent Security Architecture (6 min) - Slides 15-17
6. Capstone Overview & Close (3 min) - Slides 18-19

**Total Slides:** 19

[Complete slide definitions follow the same pattern as Session 1, adapted for Session 2 content covering data security, assessment methodology, red teaming, and multi-agent architecture]

## Appendix A: Slide Type Definitions (Condensed)

**CONCEPT**: Introduces new idea or framework - focus on clarity and single concept
**DEMO**: Live demonstration or walkthrough - have backup plan if tech fails
**INSIGHT**: Delivers key learning or aha moment - emphasize and pause after
**TRANSITION**: Bridges sections - keep brief, preview what's coming
**SUMMARY**: Reinforces key points - use repetition intentionally

## Appendix B: Visual Design Guidelines

**Color Palette - Advanced Green Theme:**
- Primary: Advanced Green #00CC99
- Secondary: Deep Blue #003D5C
- Accent: Bright Orange #FF6B35
- Neutral: Cool Gray #708090
- Warning/Alert: Amber #FFA500

**Typography:**
- Headers: Bold, size 32-44pt
- Body: Regular, size 18-24pt
- Code/Technical: Monospace, size 16-20pt
- Ensure sufficient contrast (WCAG AA minimum)

**Graphic Standards:**
- Every slide with technical content needs a supporting graphic
- Graphics must be referenced in speaker notes
- Use consistent icon set throughout presentation
- Label all diagram elements clearly
- Show relationships with arrows/connectors

**Layout Principles:**
- Maximum 3 main points per slide
- White space is valuable - don't overcrowd
- Align elements to grid
- Consistent margins across all slides

## Appendix C: Quality Checklist

**Speaker Notes Quality:**
- [ ] Every content slide has speaker notes
- [ ] Notes include delivery cues ([Pause], [Emphasize], [Transition])
- [ ] Approximate timing aligns with segment durations
- [ ] Questions and transitions scripted
- [ ] Backup explanations prepared for complex topics

**Technical Quality:**
- [ ] All code examples are syntactically correct
- [ ] Architecture diagrams are technically sound
- [ ] Commands have been tested
- [ ] Links and references are valid
- [ ] Version numbers and dates are current
