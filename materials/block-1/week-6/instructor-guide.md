## Session Delivery Guide

### Opening (5 minutes)

**Opening Script:**
> "Welcome to Week 6. Last week we covered collaboration and documentation. Today we're tackling organization - how to structure your library so you can find anything in 30 seconds.
>
> Right now you have 5-10 templates. By the capstone, you might have 20. In real work, you could have 50 or more. Without organization, that becomes chaos. Let's prevent that."

---

### Segment 1: The Organization Challenge (8 minutes)

**Key Point 1: Scale Creates Problems**
- 5 templates: Easy to remember
- 20 templates: Starting to forget what exists
- 50+ templates: Can't find anything
- Team library: Complete chaos

**Key Point 2: Symptoms of Poor Organization**
- Recreating prompts you already have
- Can't find the "good" version
- Similar templates with slight differences
- No one knows what exists

**Key Point 3: The Goal**
- Find any template in under 30 seconds
- Know immediately if a template exists
- Understand purpose without opening
- Enable team discovery

---

### Segment 2: Taxonomy Design (12 minutes)

**Key Point 1: What Is Taxonomy**
- Classification system for your prompts
- Hierarchical categories
- Consistent structure

**Key Point 2: Three Approaches**
- By deliverable type (emails, reports, proposals)
- By use case (client communication, research, content)
- By audience (executive, technical, client-facing)
- Hybrid recommended

**Key Point 3: Choosing Your Taxonomy**
- List current templates
- Group naturally by how you think of them
- Look for patterns
- Max 3 levels of hierarchy

**Demo Talking Points:**
> "There's no universal right answer. The best taxonomy is one that matches how YOU think about your work."
> "If you naturally think 'I need an email template,' organize by type. If you think 'I need something for this client project,' organize by use case."

---

### Segment 3: Naming Conventions (10 minutes)

**Key Point 1: Why Naming Matters**
- Names are primary discovery method
- Consistent naming = predictable finding
- Names survive reorganization

**Key Point 2: The Naming Pattern**
```
[type]-[specificity]-[variant].md
```
Examples:
- `email-client-formal.md`
- `report-weekly-technical.md`
- `analysis-competitive-deep.md`

**Key Point 3: Rules**
- Lowercase always
- Hyphens for spaces
- Most general → most specific
- No abbreviations
- Action-oriented when possible

---

### Segment 4: Metadata & Index + Close (10 minutes)

**Key Point 1: Template Metadata Headers**
```markdown
---
title: Client Proposal Email
category: communication/client
tags: [email, proposal, formal]
version: 2.1
last_updated: 2024-12-15
---
```

**Key Point 2: Template Index**
- Central document listing all templates
- Quick navigation
- Search by tags

**Homework Preview:**
> "Three exercises this week:
> - Exercise 6.1: Design your taxonomy
> - Exercise 6.2: Reorganize your repository
> - Exercise 6.3: Create template index
>
> These directly prepare your capstone. Good organization is a requirement."

## Anticipated Questions & Answers

**Q: What if I don't have enough templates to need organization?**
A: Start simple now. The structure scales. Better to have organization in place before you need it.

**Q: What if my categories overlap?**
A: Some overlap is normal. Put templates in the most logical primary location. Use tags for secondary categorization.

**Q: How often should I reorganize?**
A: Monthly review, quarterly audit. Move things as your understanding evolves.

## Quick Reference Cards

### Key Messages to Emphasize

1. "The best taxonomy matches how YOU think about your work"
2. "Consistent naming compounds - a few rules applied everywhere"
3. "The index is your single source of truth for what exists"

### If You Only Have Time For One Thing

Naming conventions. Taxonomy can be adjusted, but inconsistent naming is hard to fix retroactively.
