## Evaluation Process

### Step 1: Receive Submission

2. Capstone summary document
3. Self-evaluation scores (optional but encouraged)

**Submission Verification Checklist:**
- [ ] Repository accessible
- [ ] README present
- [ ] Templates folder exists
- [ ] style.json present
- [ ] Rubrics folder exists
- [ ] Task priority matrix present

---

### Step 2: Review Each Criterion

**Criterion 1: Template Quality & Documentation (5 points)**

| Score | What to Look For |
|-------|------------------|
| 5 | All templates fully documented with metadata, purpose, variables, examples (real AI output), rubric links |
| 4 | Well-documented with minor gaps; examples present |
| 3 | Basic documentation; some examples missing; metadata partial |
| 2 | Minimal documentation; few examples |
| 1 | Templates lack documentation; unusable by others |

**Red Flags:**
- Placeholder text instead of real examples
- Missing variable descriptions
- No metadata headers

---

**Criterion 2: Variety & Coverage (5 points)**

| Score | What to Look For |
|-------|------------------|
| 5 | 7+ templates covering diverse use cases; multiple techniques (role, few-shot) |
| 4 | 5-6 templates with good variety; multiple techniques |
| 3 | 5 templates with some variety; at least 2 techniques |
| 2 | Fewer than 5 OR all very similar |
| 1 | Missing templates or no variety |

**What Counts as Variety:**
- Different deliverable types (emails, reports, analysis)
- Different prompting techniques used
- Different audiences or contexts

---

**Criterion 3: style.json Sophistication (5 points)**

| Score | What to Look For |
|-------|------------------|
| 5 | Comprehensive; all sections complete; evidence of testing; usage documentation |
| 4 | Good coverage; most sections complete; some testing evidence |
| 3 | Basic style.json; core preferences defined |
| 2 | Minimal; missing key sections |
| 1 | Absent or non-functional JSON |

**Check For:**
- Valid JSON syntax
- Personalized content (not just template defaults)
- Evidence of actual use in prompts

---

**Criterion 4: Quality System Implementation (5 points)**

| Score | What to Look For |
|-------|------------------|
| 5 | 2+ rubrics with specific criteria; LLM-as-judge evidence; rubrics linked to templates |
| 4 | 2 rubrics with clear criteria; some quality testing |
| 3 | At least 1 rubric; basic criteria |
| 2 | Minimal quality system; vague criteria |
| 1 | No rubrics or evaluation system |

**Specific Criteria Test:**
Look at score descriptions. Are they specific ("Purpose in first sentence") or vague ("Good clarity")?

---

**Criterion 5: Repository Organization (5 points)**

| Score | What to Look For |
|-------|------------------|
| 5 | Clear taxonomy; consistent naming; complete index; READMEs in folders; easy navigation |
| 4 | Good organization; index present; minor inconsistencies |
| 3 | Basic organization; README exists but incomplete |
| 2 | Poor organization; hard to find things |
| 1 | No organization; no README; chaotic |

**Quick Navigation Test:**
Can you find a specific template type in under 30 seconds?

---

**Criterion 6: Practical Application (5 points)**

| Score | What to Look For |
|-------|------------------|
| 5 | Task matrix with 10+ tasks; evidence of templates used for real work; Block 2 candidates identified |
| 4 | Task matrix with good analysis; some practical use evidence |
| 3 | Basic task matrix; templates appear used |
| 2 | Minimal practical application; theoretical |
| 1 | No evidence of practical use |

**Evidence of Real Use:**
- Examples with actual AI responses
- Task matrix entries match templates created
- Notes about what worked/didn't work

---

### Step 3: Calculate Final Score

## Common Issues and Responses

### Issue: Self-Evaluation Much Higher Than Reality

**Indicators:**
- Self-score of 28+ but missing components
- Claims of "excellent" with placeholder content

**Response:**
- Provide specific evidence for lower scores
- Reference exact rubric criteria
- Be kind but factual

### Issue: Incomplete Submission

**Indicators:**
- Missing task matrix
- Only 3 templates
- No quality rubrics

**Response:**
- Identify specific gaps
- Offer extension if appropriate
- Point to requirements document

### Issue: Quality vs. Quantity Mismatch

**Indicators:**
- 15 templates, all poorly documented
- Breadth without depth

**Response:**
- Reinforce quality focus
- Suggest reducing quantity, improving quality
- Highlight best templates as models

---

## Resubmission Process

**Resubmission Policy:**
- One resubmission allowed
- Must address all identified gaps
- Deadline: 1 week after initial feedback
- Focus on specific improvements

**Resubmission Review:**
- Focus on identified gaps
- Acknowledge improvements
- Update scores accordingly

---

## Block 2 Transition

**For Passing Participants:**
1. Confirm Block 2 enrollment eligibility
2. Share Block 2 start date and requirements
3. Recommend reviewing [Block 1 to Block 2 Checkpoint](../../checkpoints/block-1-to-2-checkpoint.md)
4. Encourage continued use of prompt library

**Prerequisites for Block 2:**
- Block 1 certification (18+ points)
- Personal Prompt Library complete
- 3+ documented templates
- style.json created
- GitHub repository organized

## Quick Reference Cards

### Key Messages for Feedback

1. "Your [specific component] shows strong understanding of [concept]"

### Scoring Calibration Notes

- **5 points** = Exceptional, could be used as an example
