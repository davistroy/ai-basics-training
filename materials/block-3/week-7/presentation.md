## Slide 7: Requirements Summary

### What You Need for Week 8

**Technical:**
- [ ] All agents working reliably
- [ ] Orchestration tested thoroughly
- [ ] Monitoring dashboard complete
- [ ] 30+ executions logged

**Documentation:**
- [ ] Architecture documented
- [ ] Operations guide complete
- [ ] User guide ready

**Business:**

---

## Slide 8: Team Rollout - Why It Matters

### Agent Value Scales with Users

Individual savings are good.

Team-level savings are **compelling**.

| Scenario | Time Saved/Month |
|----------|------------------|
| You alone | 5 hours |
| 5 team members | 25 hours |
| 10 team members | 50 hours |

**An agent only delivers value when people actually use it.**

---

## Slide 9: Rollout Questions to Answer

### Planning for Real-World Deployment

Before deploying, answer:

- **Who** will use the agent?
- **What access** do they need?
- **How** will they trigger it?
- **What training** is required?
- **How** will issues be reported?

Don't assume users will figure it out.

---

## Slide 10: Three-Phase Rollout

### Phased Approach Reduces Risk

```
Phase 1: PILOT (1-2 users)
├── Test in real conditions
├── Gather feedback
└── Fix issues discovered

Phase 2: EXPAND (5-10 users)
├── Broader testing
├── Refine documentation
└── Build confidence

Phase 3: FULL DEPLOY
├── All target users
├── Self-service access
└── Standard support process
```

---

## Slide 11: Phase Success Criteria

### Gate Each Transition

| Phase | Success Criteria to Advance |
|-------|---------------------------|
| **Pilot** | X successful executions, <Y% error rate, positive feedback |
| **Expand** | Users self-sufficient, documentation sufficient |
| **Full** | Phase 2 criteria met, management approval |

**Don't advance until criteria are met.**

---

## Slide 12: Training and Support Plan

### Making Users Successful

**Training Elements:**
- User guide documentation
- Quick start for first use
- FAQ for common questions
- Escalation process for issues

**Support Channels:**
- Where do users get help?
- How do they report issues?
- When does it escalate to you?

---

## Slide 13: Rollout Plan Template Preview

### What You'll Create in Exercise 7.2

```markdown
# Team Rollout Plan

## Target Users
- Primary users: [Who]
- User count: [Number]

## Phase 1: Pilot
- Participants: [Names]
- Success criteria: [Specific metrics]

## Phase 2: Expand
- Add X more users
- Success criteria: [Specific metrics]

## Phase 3: Full Deploy
- Prerequisites: [Phase 2 success]
- Ongoing support: [Process]
```

---

## Slide 14: ROI - Why Actual Data Matters

### Projections vs Reality

| Type | Credibility |
|------|-------------|
| "I think this will save time" | Low |
| "I estimate 30% savings" | Medium |
| "I saved 12 hours over 35 executions" | **High** |

**Actual data from your executions is more compelling than any projection.**

---

## Slide 15: ROI Components

### Four Value Areas

| Component | How to Measure |
|-----------|---------------|
| **Time Savings** | (Manual time - Agent time) x Executions |
| **Quality Improvement** | Error reduction, rework avoided |
| **Capacity Expansion** | Additional work now possible |
| **Cost Avoidance** | Problems prevented |

Plus: Costs (API, platform, development, maintenance)

---

## Slide 16: ROI Framework

### Calculating Net Benefit

```
MONTHLY VALUE
├── Time savings: $X (hours saved x hourly rate)
├── Rework avoided: $Y (errors prevented x cost)
└── Total value: $X + $Y

MONTHLY COSTS
├── API costs: $A (actual usage)
├── Maintenance: $B (time estimate)
└── Total cost: $A + $B

NET MONTHLY BENEFIT = Value - Costs
ROI % = (Net Benefit / Costs) x 100
```

---

## Slide 17: Payback Period

### When Does Development Pay Off?

```
Development Investment (one-time):
- Your time building: X hours x hourly rate
- Testing and refinement: Y hours x hourly rate
- Total: $Z

Payback Period = Development Investment / Monthly Net Benefit

Example:
- Development: $2,000
- Monthly benefit: $500
- Payback: 4 months
```

**After payback, it's pure value.**

---

## Slide 18: Team Scale Power

### The Multiplication Effect

| Metric | Individual | 5-Person Team | 10-Person Team |
|--------|------------|---------------|----------------|
| Hours saved/month | 5 | 25 | 50 |
| Value generated | $250 | $1,250 | $2,500 |
| Operating costs | $50 | ~$50 | ~$50 |
| **Net benefit** | **$200** | **$1,200** | **$2,450** |

*Operating costs scale minimally - API costs per execution stay constant.*

---

## Slide 19: ROI Template Preview

### What You'll Create in Exercise 7.3

```markdown
# Block 3 ROI Analysis

## Time Savings Analysis
- Executions: N
- Time saved per execution: X min
- Total time saved: Y hours
- Value: $Z

## Costs
- Development: $A (one-time)
- Monthly operating: $B

## ROI Calculation
- Monthly ROI: X%
- Payback period: Y months

## Team Projection
- 5 team members: $X/month value
```

## Instructor Notes

### Timing Guidance

- **Segment 1 (Requirements):** Critical for setting expectations - don't rush
- **Segment 2 (Rollout):** Practical and concrete - use examples
- **Segment 3 (ROI):** Numbers-heavy - go slowly through formulas
- **Segment 4 (Close):** Emphasize Week 8 is self-paced

### Common Questions

- "What if ROI is negative?" - Document honestly, valuable learning
- "How detailed should rollout be?" - Specific enough to actually follow
- "Can I use projected data?" - Actual data strongly preferred

### Demo Suggestions

- Show sample ROI calculation with real numbers
- Walk through rollout plan example
- Show documentation checklist in action
