## Slide 4: Evaluation Criteria Reminder

### 8 Criteria x 5 Points = 40 Total

| # | Criterion | # | Criterion |
|---|-----------|---|-----------|
| 1 | Agent Architecture | 5 | Documentation Quality |
| 2 | Reliability & Error Handling | 6 | Production Readiness |
| 3 | Performance & Optimization | 7 | Business Impact |
| 4 | Monitoring & Observability | 8 | Team Deployment Potential |

**Certification:** 34+ points (85%) = AI Automation Architect

**SPEAKER NOTES:**

[Note: No live session - these notes are for reference if instructor offers office hours]

"Eight evaluation criteria, five points each.

The 85% threshold (34 points) is intentionally high. This certification means production-ready work, not just functional prototypes.

Each criterion has clear rubric definitions - 5 is excellent, 3 is adequate, 1 is missing. You know exactly what's expected."

**BACKGROUND:**

**Rationale:**
- The eight criteria comprehensively assess Block 3 learning: technical (1-4), professional (5-6), business (7-8)
- 85% certification threshold reflects Block 3's advanced nature - agent systems are complex, certification should reflect mastery
- Equal weighting (5 pts each) prevents participants from ignoring "soft" deliverables like documentation
- Self-evaluation option encourages honest assessment and metacognition

**Key Research & Citations:**
- **Bloom's Taxonomy - Evaluation Level**: Capstone assessment requires synthesis and evaluation - highest cognitive levels demonstrating mastery
- **Certification Standards (CompTIA, AWS)**: Industry certifications typically require 70-80% passing scores; 85% signals advanced proficiency
- **Rubric-Based Assessment Research**: Clear rubrics with performance levels improve learning outcomes and reduce subjective grading variance

**Q&A Preparation:**
- *"Why 85% when Blocks 1-2 were 55%?"*: Blocks 1-2 are foundational; Block 3 is advanced. Agents are production systems - higher bar is appropriate.
- *"What if I'm close but not 34 points?"*: You'll receive detailed feedback. Many participants iterate and resubmit after addressing gaps.
- *"Is self-evaluation used for grading?"*: Recommended but not graded. Helps you calibrate expectations and identify areas needing work before submission.

## Slide 14: Self-Evaluation Tips

### Be Honest With Yourself

**Questions to consider:**

1. Would I trust this to run unsupervised?
2. Can I prove the business value with data?
3. Could someone else use this from my documentation?
4. What's the biggest remaining risk?
5. What would I do differently with more time?

**Inflated self-evaluations don't help you learn.**
