## Evaluation Guidelines

### Using the 8-Criterion Rubric

**Score each criterion 1-5 points:**

| Score | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| 5 | Excellent - Professional quality, exceeds expectations |
| 4 | Good - Solid work, minor improvements possible |
| 3 | Adequate - Meets minimum requirements |
| 2 | Poor - Below expectations, significant gaps |
| 1 | Missing - Criterion not addressed or non-functional |

### Evaluation Criteria Quick Reference

| # | Criterion | What to Look For |
|---|-----------|-----------------|
| 1 | Agent Architecture | Multi-agent design, clear specialization, appropriate orchestration |
| 2 | Reliability & Error Handling | Error handling, retry logic, success rate >80% |
| 3 | Performance & Optimization | Efficiency, cost awareness, optimization evidence |
| 4 | Monitoring & Observability | Dashboard, metrics, alerting |
| 5 | Documentation Quality | Complete, usable by others |
| 6 | Production Readiness | Could deploy to real use |
| 7 | Business Impact | ROI with actual data |
| 8 | Team Deployment Potential | Realistic rollout plan |

### Scoring Calibration

**5 Points (Excellent):**
- Professional quality work
- Could be deployed immediately
- Clear evidence of mastery
- Goes beyond minimum requirements

**3 Points (Adequate):**
- Meets basic requirements
- Functional but room for improvement
- Some gaps or limitations
- Would need work before deployment

**1 Point (Missing):**
- Criterion not addressed
- Non-functional or incomplete
- Cannot evaluate this dimension

## Performance Levels

### Certification Thresholds

| Score Range | Level | Certification |
|-------------|-------|---------------|
| 34-40 (85%+) | Excellent | **AI Automation Architect** |
| 28-33 (70-84%) | Good | Certificate of Completion |
| 22-27 (55-69%) | Adequate | Conditional - improvement needed |
| <22 (<55%) | Needs Improvement | Not certified - significant gaps |

### Handling Edge Cases

**Score of 33 (just below certification):**
- Review carefully - is there a criterion that could reasonably be 4 instead of 3?
- Be fair but not lenient
- Document reasoning

**Missing components:**
- Cannot score criteria without evidence
- Missing ROI analysis = 1 point for Business Impact
- Missing rollout plan = 1 point for Team Deployment

**Self-evaluation vs. your evaluation:**
- Discrepancies are normal
- Use your evaluation as final score
- Provide specific feedback on discrepancies
