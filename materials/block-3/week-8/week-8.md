   - Is it reliable enough?
   - Are failures handled gracefully?
   - Can it recover from problems?

2. **Can I prove the business value?**
   - Do I have actual data?
   - Is the ROI compelling?
   - Would leadership approve deployment?

3. **Could my team use this?**
   - Is documentation complete?
   - Is training possible?
   - Is support manageable?

4. **What's the biggest risk?**
   - Have I mitigated it?
   - Do I have a contingency?
   - Am I being honest about limitations?

5. **What would I do differently?**
   - In the architecture?
   - In the implementation?
   - In the deployment plan?
