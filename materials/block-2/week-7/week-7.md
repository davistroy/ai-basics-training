### Segment 2: Impact Measurement with Real Data (15 min)

**Collecting actual metrics:**
- Pull from execution logs
- Compare to Block 1 baseline
- Calculate real time savings

**Impact calculation framework:**

```markdown
## Time Savings (Actual)
- Manual process (Block 1): X minutes/execution
- Automated (Block 2): Y minutes/execution
- Savings per execution: X - Y = Z minutes
- Total executions (Block 2): N
- Total time saved: Z × N = hours

## Quality Improvement (Actual)
- Average quality score: X.X/5
- % requiring revision: X%
- Comparison to manual baseline

## Cost Analysis (Actual)
- AI costs (Block 2): $X
- Platform costs: $X
- Total automation cost: $X
- Value of time saved: hours × rate = $X
- Net ROI: Value - Costs = $X
```

**Projecting annual impact:**
- Based on actual usage rates
- Accounting for team scale potential

   - Success/failure rates
   - Human review rates

2. **Calculate actual metrics:**

```markdown
# Block 2 Impact Report

## Execution Summary
- Total workflow executions: [N]
- Date range: [Start] to [End]
- Workflows in production: [3]

## Time Savings (Actual Data)

| Workflow | Manual Time | Automated Time | Savings/Exec | Executions | Total Saved |
|----------|-------------|----------------|--------------|------------|-------------|
| WF1 | X min | Y min | Z min | N | hours |
| WF2 | | | | | |
| WF3 | | | | | |
| **Total** | | | | | **X hours** |

## Quality Metrics (Actual Data)

| Workflow | Avg Quality Score | Pass Rate | Review Rate | Revision Rate |
|----------|-------------------|-----------|-------------|---------------|
| WF1 | X.X/5 | X% | X% | X% |
| WF2 | | | | |
| WF3 | | | | |

## Cost Analysis (Actual Data)

| Category | Amount |
|----------|--------|
| AI API costs (total) | $X |
| Platform costs | $X |
| **Total Automation Cost** | $X |
| | |
| Time saved (hours) | X |
| Value @ $150/hr | $X |
| **Net Value** | $X |
| **ROI** | X% |

## Annual Projection

Based on actual usage rate of [X] executions/week:
