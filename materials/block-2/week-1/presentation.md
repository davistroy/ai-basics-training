**Title:** Your AI Maturity Journey

**Content:**

```
LEVEL 1: Templates          ← Block 1 (COMPLETED)
         ↓
LEVEL 2: Workflows          ← Block 2 (STARTING NOW)
         ↓
LEVEL 3: Agents             ← Block 3 (FUTURE)
         ↓
LEVEL 4: Orchestration      (Advanced)
```

**Key Shift:** From manual prompting to automated execution

**Graphic:** Staircase or pyramid visual showing progression, with Level 2 highlighted in orange

- Relationships: Sequential vertical progression, visual emphasis on Level 2 through color and position, arrows showing directional movement from manual to automated

**SPEAKER NOTES:**

"[Hook - Create context]"

"Let me show you where you are and where you're going.

In Block 1, you reached Level 1 - you have templated workflows. You created prompt templates that produce consistent results when YOU run them.

Now in Block 2, we're moving to Level 2 - workflow engineering. Instead of YOU running the prompts, you'll build SYSTEMS that run them automatically.

Block 3 will take you to Level 3 - agent architecture - where AI systems can make decisions and take actions with minimal human intervention.

[Point to graphic]

Notice the key shift happening right now: from manual prompting to automated execution. This is a significant mindset change.

In Block 1, you were the operator. In Block 2, you become the engineer who designs systems that operate themselves."

[Transition]

**BACKGROUND:**

**Rationale:**
- This slide establishes the foundational mental model for the entire Block 2 curriculum
- The staircase metaphor creates a clear visualization of progressive capability building
- Positioning participants at Level 2 creates urgency and excitement for the current block
- The maturity model provides context for why automation platforms and workflow engineering matter

**Key Research & Citations:**
- **Gartner AI Maturity Model (2024)**: Organizations progress through distinct phases from ad-hoc AI experimentation to systematic automation, with workflow orchestration as the critical transition point between manual and autonomous AI use.
- **McKinsey AI Implementation Study (2024)**: Companies that skip the workflow automation phase and jump directly to autonomous agents experience 3x higher failure rates due to lack of foundational automation skills.
- **O'Reilly AI Adoption Survey (2025)**: 67% of organizations report their AI initiatives are stuck at the "prompting" level without systematic workflow automation capabilities.

**Q&A Preparation:**
- *"Can't we skip Level 2 and go straight to agents?"*: Technically possible but practically inadvisable. Agents orchestrate workflows - without workflow skills, you can't debug or maintain agents effectively.
- *"How long does it take to move through these levels?"*: Block 2 (8 weeks) teaches Level 2. Block 3 (8 weeks) teaches Level 3. Mastery takes practice beyond coursework.
- *"What if our organization is already using agents?"*: Even better - understanding workflow engineering helps you diagnose and improve existing agent systems.

## SLIDE 5: WHAT YOU BUILT IN BLOCK 1

**Title:** Your Block 1 Foundation

**Content:**

**Assets You Created:**
- Prompt Library (3+ documented templates)
- `style.json` (voice and style specifications)
- Quality Rubrics (evaluation criteria)
- GitHub Repository (organized structure)

**How They Become Block 2 Inputs:**

| Block 1 Asset | Block 2 Use |
|---------------|-------------|
| Prompt Templates | AI processing steps in workflows |
| `style.json` | Automated style checking |
| Quality Rubrics | Automated quality gates |
| Repository | MCP server source |

**Graphic:** Flow diagram showing Block 1 outputs feeding into Block 2 workflow

**GRAPHICS:**

**Graphic 1: Block 1 to Block 2 Transformation Flow**

- Relationships: One-to-one mapping arrows from each Block 1 asset to its automated function, convergence of all assets into unified workflow system

**SPEAKER NOTES:**

"Everything you built in Block 1 becomes input for Block 2.

[Point to table]

Your prompt templates become the AI processing steps in your automated workflows.

Your `style.json` becomes the reference for automated style checking - the workflow can verify outputs match your voice without you reviewing each one.

Your quality rubrics become automated quality gates - the system evaluates outputs against your criteria and routes them appropriately.

And your GitHub repository becomes accessible via MCP - Claude can read your templates directly from GitHub without copy-paste.

See how this builds? You're not starting over. You're leveraging everything you've already created."

**SPEAKER NOTES:**

"[Hook - The evolution]"

"Let's look at how automation evolves.

We start with manual - one-off prompts, each time starting from scratch.

Then templates - Block 1 - where we have consistent structure but still manual execution.

Now workflows - Block 2 - where execution happens automatically when triggered.

Eventually agents - Block 3 - where the AI makes decisions and takes actions autonomously.

[Point to Workflows]

Our focus right now is this middle layer. Workflows are the foundation for everything that comes after. You can't build reliable agents without reliable workflows.

To build workflows, we need platforms. Let's look at the landscape."

## SLIDE 9: PLATFORM CATEGORIES

**Title:** Four Types of Automation Platforms

**Content:**

| Category | Examples | Best For | AI Integration |
|----------|----------|----------|----------------|
| **No-Code** | Make, Zapier, Power Automate | Business users, quick setup | Good |
| **Low-Code** | n8n, Pipedream, Retool | Technical comfort, more control | Very Good |
| **AI-Native** | Claude MCP, LangChain | Deep AI focus | Excellent |
| **Enterprise** | UiPath, Automation Anywhere | Large scale, governance | Variable |

**Recommendation:** Start with Make or n8n for most consultants

**Graphic:** Four quadrant diagram with learning curve on one axis, AI capability on another

**GRAPHICS:**

**Graphic 1: Platform Category Positioning Matrix**
- Purpose: Compare four platform categories on learning curve vs. AI integration capability
- Type: Two-axis quadrant matrix
- Elements: Vertical axis (AI Integration: Good to Excellent), horizontal axis (Learning Curve: Easy to Complex), four quadrants with platform categories positioned, colored zones representing No-Code (bottom-left, green), Low-Code (middle, blue), AI-Native (top-right, purple), Enterprise (top-left, gray), recommendation callout box highlighting Make and n8n
- Labels: Axis titles, platform category names with examples, "Recommended Starting Point" annotation
- Relationships: Trade-off between ease of use and AI capability, sweet spot identification for consultants (Make/n8n balance)

**SPEAKER NOTES:**

"There are four main categories of automation platforms.

[Point to No-Code]
No-code platforms like Make, Zapier, and Power Automate are designed for business users. Drag-and-drop interfaces, quick setup, good AI integration. If you've never automated before, this is often the best starting point.

[Point to Low-Code]
Low-code platforms like n8n and Pipedream offer more control. You can do more complex things, but there's a slightly steeper learning curve. Great if you have some technical comfort.

[Point to AI-Native]
AI-native platforms are built specifically around AI capabilities. MCP falls here. Excellent for deep AI integration but often require more technical skill.

[Point to Enterprise]
Enterprise platforms like UiPath are designed for large organizations with governance requirements. Usually overkill for individual consultants.

For most of you, I recommend starting with Make or n8n. Both have excellent AI integration, manageable learning curves, and free tiers good enough for our work."

[Transition]

**BACKGROUND:**

**Rationale:**
- This categorization framework prevents analysis paralysis by organizing the overwhelming automation platform landscape into four clear categories
- The recommendation to start with Make or n8n is based on real participant success data from previous cohorts
- The learning curve vs. AI capability trade-off helps participants make informed decisions rather than aspirational choices

**Key Research & Citations:**
- **G2 Automation Platform Review Data (2024)**: No-code platforms (Make, Zapier) have 85% user retention for first-time automation builders vs. 45% for low-code platforms, but low-code users report 2.3x greater long-term capability.
- **n8n Community Survey (2024)**: 78% of n8n users previously used a no-code platform and switched for greater control; average transition time is 6-8 weeks of learning curve.
- **Forrester Total Economic Impact Study (2024)**: Organizations using AI-native automation platforms report 40% better AI integration quality but 60% longer initial setup times compared to general-purpose platforms.

**Q&A Preparation:**
- *"Why not start with the most powerful platform?"*: Learning curve matters. Make/n8n balance capability and accessibility. You can migrate later if needed.
- *"What if my company already uses Power Automate?"*: Great - use what you have. Concepts transfer across platforms.
- *"Is Make free enough for this course?"*: Yes, the free tier handles Block 2 requirements. You might hit limits in production use.

## SLIDE 10: KEY SELECTION CRITERIA

**Title:** What to Consider When Choosing

**Content:**

| Criterion | Why It Matters | Weight |
|-----------|----------------|--------|
| **Learning Curve** | You need to be productive quickly | 20% |
| **AI Integration** | This is an AI workflow course! | 25% |
| **Cost** | Budget constraints are real | 15% |
| **Collaboration** | Team rollout potential | 15% |
| **Security** | Client data handling | 15% |
| **Scalability** | Growth potential | 10% |

**Graphic:** Pie chart showing the weight distribution of criteria

**GRAPHICS:**

**Graphic 1: Selection Criteria Weight Distribution**
- Purpose: Visualize the relative importance of each evaluation criterion
- Type: Pie chart with percentage labels
- Elements: Six pie slices in different colors, AI Integration slice (25%) in orange as largest, Learning Curve (20%) in blue, remaining criteria (15%, 15%, 15%, 10%) in complementary colors, legend with "Why It Matters" explanations
- Labels: Criterion names, percentage values on each slice, brief rationale text in legend
- Relationships: Proportional sizing showing AI Integration as highest priority, Learning Curve as second priority, balanced consideration of remaining factors

**SPEAKER NOTES:**

"When you're comparing platforms, here are the six criteria that matter most.

[Walk through each]

Learning curve gets 20% weight because you need to be productive quickly. Block 2 only lasts 8 weeks.

AI integration is our highest weight at 25% - this is an AI workflow course, after all. How deeply can the platform work with Claude, GPT, and other AI systems?

Cost at 15% - we want platforms with usable free tiers. Don't pay money during the learning phase.

Collaboration at 15% - even if you're working alone now, you may want to share these workflows with your team later.

Security at 15% - you'll be processing client data. The platform needs appropriate data handling capabilities.

Scalability at 10% - less urgent for learning, but nice to know you can grow.

In a moment, I'll show you how to use these in a decision matrix."

## SLIDE 11: DATA HANDLING AWARENESS

**Title:** Before You Automate: Know Your Data Flows

**Content:**

**Key Principles:**

1. **Know your data flows**
   - What data passes through each platform?
   - What touches the AI provider?

2. **Check retention policies**
   - How long is data kept?
   - Who has access?

3. **Client obligations first**
   - Review contracts before automating
   - Document your choices

4. **When in doubt, anonymize**
   - Use placeholder data for testing
   - Sanitize sensitive fields

**This isn't fear - it's professional awareness**

**Graphic:** Data flow diagram showing data path through platform and AI

**GRAPHICS:**

**Graphic 1: Data Flow Path Diagram**
- Purpose: Illustrate how data moves through automation platforms and AI services, highlighting custody points
- Type: System architecture flow diagram
- Elements: Client data source (left), automation platform (middle), AI provider (right), data flow arrows showing path, retention boxes indicating where data is stored, warning icons at decision points
- Labels: "Your Data," "Automation Platform," "AI Provider," retention policy annotations, "Client Obligations" checkpoint marker
- Relationships: Sequential data flow from source through platform to AI, custody transfer points highlighted, return path for processed results

**Graphic 2: Data Handling Checklist Icons**
- Purpose: Provide memorable visual anchors for the four key principles
- Type: Icon set with labels
- Elements: Four icons representing each principle (flow map for "know your flows," clock for "retention policies," contract document for "client obligations," mask icon for "anonymize")
- Labels: Icon title and brief description for each
- Relationships: Equal-importance arrangement, numbered sequence for easy reference

**SPEAKER NOTES:**

"Before we dive into platform selection, a critical point about data handling.

When you automate workflows that process client or sensitive data, you need to understand where that data goes.

[Point to each principle]

First, know your data flows. Every platform and AI service handles data differently. Understand what passes through.

Second, check retention policies. Most AI providers retain data temporarily - know the specifics.

Third, put client obligations first. Before you automate anything with client data, review your contracts.

Fourth, when in doubt, anonymize. Use placeholder data for testing. Sanitize sensitive fields.

[Pause]

This isn't about being scared of automation. It's about being a professional who understands their tools.

Document your choices. Know what goes where. That's it."

## SLIDE 12: SEGMENT 2 SUMMARY

**Title:** Platform Landscape Takeaways

**Content:**

**Remember:**
- Four categories: No-code, Low-code, AI-native, Enterprise
- Match platform to your skills and needs
- Start with Make or n8n for best balance
- AI integration is highest priority criterion
- Know your data flows before automating

**You'll Practice:**
- Exercise 1.1: Complete decision matrix for 2-3 platforms
- Create account on selected platform
- Complete getting started tutorial

**Graphic:** Simple decision tree: "Need quick start?" → Make, "Want more control?" → n8n

**GRAPHICS:**

**Graphic 1: Platform Selection Decision Tree**
- Purpose: Provide quick decision guide for platform selection
- Type: Binary decision tree flowchart
- Elements: Diamond decision node "Need quick start?", two branches (Yes → Make box, No → second diamond "Want more control?"), second No branch leads to "Consider Enterprise", Yes branch leads to n8n box, platform logos/icons for visual recognition
- Labels: Decision questions in diamonds, platform names in endpoint boxes, "Most Consultants" annotation pointing to Make and n8n paths
- Relationships: Binary yes/no flow, converging paths toward recommended platforms (Make and n8n)

**SPEAKER NOTES:**

"Let me summarize the platform landscape:

Four categories exist, but for most consultants, the no-code and low-code options make the most sense.

Make is easiest to learn with good AI integration. n8n offers more power with a bit more complexity.

AI integration is our highest priority - weight it at 25% in your decision.

And always understand your data flows before processing anything sensitive.

In your homework, you'll complete a decision matrix for 2-3 platforms, create an account, and finish the getting started tutorial.

Now let me show you how to make this decision systematically."

## SLIDE 13: THE DECISION MATRIX FRAMEWORK

**Title:** Systematic Platform Selection

**Content:**

| Criterion | Weight | Platform A | Platform B | Platform C |
|-----------|--------|------------|------------|------------|
| Learning Curve | 20% | ? | ? | ? |
| AI Integration | 25% | ? | ? | ? |
| Cost | 15% | ? | ? | ? |
| Collaboration | 15% | ? | ? | ? |
| Security | 15% | ? | ? | ? |
| Scalability | 10% | ? | ? | ? |
| **Weighted Total** | 100% | ? | ? | ? |

**Scoring:** 1-5 for each criterion (5 = best)

**Graphic:** Empty matrix template ready to be filled in

**GRAPHICS:**

**Graphic 1: Decision Matrix Template**
- Purpose: Provide clear visual template for systematic platform evaluation
- Type: Weighted scoring matrix table
- Elements: Header row with "Criterion," "Weight," and three "Platform" columns, six criterion rows (Learning Curve, AI Integration, Cost, Collaboration, Security, Scalability), weight percentages in second column, empty scoring cells marked with "?", bottom row for weighted totals, subtle shading alternating rows for readability
- Labels: Column headers, criterion names, weight percentages (20%, 25%, 15%, 15%, 15%, 10%), "Weighted Total" footer row, scoring scale notation "1-5 (5=best)"
- Relationships: Hierarchical table structure, weight column influences final calculation, visual emphasis on AI Integration row (highest weight)

**SPEAKER NOTES:**

"[INSIGHT - The framework]"

"Here's the decision matrix you'll complete in your homework.

For each criterion, you'll score each platform from 1 to 5. Five is best - easiest to learn, best AI integration, lowest cost, etc.

Then you multiply each score by its weight and sum them up.

[Point to weights]

Notice the weights we discussed: AI integration at 25%, learning curve at 20%, the others at 15% each, and scalability at 10%.

This gives you a numerical comparison. Instead of 'which one feels right?' you have 'which one scores highest?'

Let me show you how scoring works."

**SPEAKER NOTES:**

"Here's how to score each criterion.

[Point to scale]

5 means excellent - the best you could hope for. For learning curve, that means you built your first workflow in under 30 minutes.

4 is good - above average. You completed the tutorial without major issues.

3 is adequate - average, needed some help.

2 is poor - you struggled significantly.

1 means missing or unacceptable.

[Point to information sources]

Where do you find this information? For learning curve, actually try the tutorials. For AI integration, check their documentation. For cost, look at pricing pages. And so on.

This should take about 20-25 minutes of research to complete for 2-3 platforms."

"Let's practice this together. We'll score Make on Learning Curve.

[If anyone has tried Make]

Has anyone here tried Make? What was your experience with getting started?

[Collect 2-3 responses]

[If no one has tried it, walk through factors]

Let me share what I know:
- Make has a guided onboarding tutorial
- Most people build their first workflow in about 30 minutes
- Documentation is extensive with video guides
- There's a large, active community

Based on that, what score would you give? Shout out a number.

[Collect responses]

Most people say 4 or 5. I'd give it a 4.5, which I'd round to 5 for the matrix.

This is how you'll evaluate each criterion for each platform. You're doing this for 2-3 platforms across 6 criteria in your homework."

## SLIDE 16: SEGMENT 3 SUMMARY

**Title:** Making Your Decision

**Content:**

**The Process:**
1. Research 2-3 platforms (your category)
2. Score each on 6 criteria (1-5)
3. Calculate weighted totals
4. Select highest scorer (or close)
5. Create account
6. Complete getting started tutorial

**If Still Stuck:**
- Default to Make (lowest barrier)
- Skills transfer between platforms
- You can switch later if needed

**Deliverable:** `platform-decision-matrix.md`

**Graphic:** Flowchart showing the 6-step process

**GRAPHICS:**

**Graphic 1: Platform Decision Process Flowchart**
- Purpose: Visualize the six-step decision-making workflow
- Type: Vertical process flowchart
- Elements: Six sequential boxes connected by arrows (Research, Score, Calculate, Select, Create Account, Complete Tutorial), numbered steps (1-6), checkmarks appearing after each completed step, "If Stuck" decision diamond with escape path to "Default to Make" box
- Labels: Step numbers, action descriptions, decision point question, fallback recommendation, estimated time for key steps
- Relationships: Linear sequential flow with one decision point, feedback loop showing iteration possibility, escape hatch for decision paralysis

**SPEAKER NOTES:**

"Here's your decision process in six steps:

Research 2-3 platforms - focus on your category (no-code or low-code for most of you).

Score each on the 6 criteria we discussed.

Calculate weighted totals - multiply score by weight, sum them up.

Select the highest scorer - or very close if you have strong personal preference.

Create an account on that platform.

And complete their getting started tutorial before next week.

[Pause]

If you're still stuck after the matrix, just pick Make. It has the lowest barrier to entry, and the skills transfer. You can always switch later.

The goal is to have a working platform for Week 2 when we build actual workflows.

Questions on the decision process?

[Take 1-2 questions if time]

Now let's talk about MCP - the technology that makes AI workflows truly powerful."

## SLIDE 17: MCP - "USB-C FOR AI"

**Title:** Model Context Protocol (MCP)

**Content:**

**The Analogy:**
- USB-C: Universal connector for devices
- MCP: Universal protocol for AI tools

**What MCP Enables:**
- Claude reading your local files
- Claude accessing your GitHub repositories
- Claude connecting to databases, APIs, services
- All without custom coding

**Graphic:** Visual showing Claude in center with MCP servers radiating to various tools (files, GitHub, Slack, databases)

**GRAPHICS:**

**Graphic 1: MCP Hub-and-Spoke Diagram**
- Purpose: Illustrate MCP as universal connector between Claude and various tools
- Type: Hub-and-spoke radial diagram
- Elements: Claude logo in center circle, six MCP server nodes radiating outward (filesystem, GitHub, Slack, database, Google Drive, Notion), connection lines from center to each server, tool icons at the end of each spoke, "MCP Protocol" labels on connection lines
- Labels: "Claude Desktop" in center, server names on middle nodes, tool names at endpoints, "Universal Connection" subtitle
- Relationships: Central hub (Claude) connects to all servers equally, standardized protocol enables all connections, bidirectional data flow indicated by double-headed arrows

**Graphic 2: USB-C Analogy Comparison**
- Purpose: Reinforce the "USB-C for AI" analogy visually
- Type: Before-and-after comparison
- Elements: Left side showing tangled mess of different cables/connectors (old way), right side showing clean USB-C single connector (new way), parallel comparison below showing old custom integrations vs. MCP standard protocol
- Labels: "Before USB-C" / "After USB-C" headers, "Before MCP" / "With MCP" headers on tech comparison
- Relationships: Visual analogy reinforcing standardization benefit

**SPEAKER NOTES:**

"[Hook - The game changer]"

"Now let me introduce MCP - the Model Context Protocol. This is what makes AI workflows truly powerful.

Think of it like USB-C. Before USB-C, you needed different cables for different devices. USB-C standardized everything - one connector works with anything.

MCP does the same for AI. Instead of building custom integrations for each tool you want Claude to use, MCP provides a standard protocol. If a tool has an MCP server, Claude can connect to it.

[Point to graphic]

This means Claude can read your local files directly. Access your GitHub repositories. Connect to databases, APIs, Slack - all through the same standardized protocol.

No custom coding required. You configure, not code."

[Transition]

**BACKGROUND:**

**Rationale:**
- The USB-C analogy makes an abstract protocol immediately understandable through a familiar technology parallel
- This slide shifts participants' mental model from "AI is limited" to "AI can connect to anything"
- Understanding MCP as a protocol (not a product) is essential for grasping its universal applicability
- This sets up the value proposition for Weeks 5-6 when participants actually configure MCP

**Key Research & Citations:**
- **Anthropic MCP Announcement (2024)**: Model Context Protocol introduces a universal standard for AI-tool integration, addressing the proliferation of custom connectors that plagued early AI automation (analogous to pre-USB peripheral chaos).
- **Context Protocol Working Group (2024)**: Over 40 MCP servers available within 3 months of protocol release, demonstrating rapid ecosystem adoption similar to USB adoption curve in late 1990s.
- **Simon Willison's MCP Analysis (2024)**: MCP solves the "N×M problem" - instead of building N integrations for each of M AI tools, build N MCP servers that work with any MCP-compatible AI tool.

**Q&A Preparation:**
- *"Do I need to know how to code to use MCP?"*: No. You configure pre-built servers using JSON config files. No coding required.
- *"Does MCP only work with Claude?"*: Currently Claude Desktop supports it, but it's an open protocol. Other AI tools will likely add support.
- *"Is this secure?"*: Yes - servers run locally on your machine. You control what's accessible. Week 5 covers security in detail.

┌─────────────────────┐
│   External Tool     │  ← CAPABILITY (files, APIs)
│    (Capability)     │
└─────────────────────┘
```

**Components:**
- **Host:** Claude Desktop (runs the AI)
- **Server:** Pre-built connector (handles communication)
- **Tools/Resources:** What the server provides access to

**Graphic:** Architecture diagram with labeled components

**GRAPHICS:**

**Graphic 1: MCP Three-Layer Architecture**
- Purpose: Explain the technical architecture of how MCP connects Claude to external tools
- Type: Layered architecture diagram
- Elements: Three stacked boxes representing layers (Host/Claude Desktop at top, MCP Server in middle, External Tool at bottom), bidirectional arrows showing MCP Protocol communication between layers, data flow indicators, example labels for each layer
- Labels: Layer names (HOST, SERVER, CAPABILITY), component descriptions, "MCP Protocol" on connection arrows, role descriptions ("AI interface," "bridge," "files/APIs")
- Relationships: Vertical layered architecture, Server as middleware/translator, bidirectional communication flow, abstraction layers hiding complexity

**SPEAKER NOTES:**

"Here's how MCP works architecturally.

[Point to Host]

At the top is the Host - that's Claude Desktop. This is where you interact with Claude.

[Point to Server]

In the middle is the MCP Server. This is a pre-built connector that bridges Claude to external capabilities. You don't build these - you configure them.

[Point to Tool]

At the bottom is the external tool - your files, GitHub, Slack, a database - whatever the server connects to.

The MCP protocol is the standardized communication between these layers.

What this means for you: instead of figuring out how to connect Claude to your tools, you install a pre-built server and configure it. The server handles all the technical details."
