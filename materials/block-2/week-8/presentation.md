## Slide 2: Week 8 Overview

### This Week: Self-Paced Evaluation

**No live workshop this week**

| Day | Activity |
|-----|----------|
| Day 1-3 | Finalize capstone materials |
| Day 4-5 | Complete self-evaluation |
| Day 5-6 | Submit everything |
| Day 6-7 | Receive feedback + certification |

### Your Focus

1. Finalize all documentation
2. Complete honest self-evaluation
3. Submit by deadline
4. Prepare for Block 3

**Speaker Notes:**
Participants work independently this week. The timeline is flexible but submission deadline is end of week. Support is available for questions.

---

## Slide 3: Submission Requirements

### What to Submit

| Item | Location | Required |
|------|----------|----------|
| GitHub Repository | Link to repo | Yes |
| Impact Report | `block-2-impact-report.md` | Yes |
| Capstone Summary | `block-2-capstone-summary.md` | Yes |
| Self-Evaluation | Completed rubric | Encouraged |

### Repository Must Include

- 3 workflow documentations
- Quality evaluation prompts
- Quality rubrics
- MCP configuration docs
- Performance logs/analysis
- Integration architecture

**Speaker Notes:**
All materials should already be in the repository from previous weeks. This week is about finalizing, not creating from scratch. Self-evaluation is optional but highly encouraged.

## Slide 4: Evaluation Criteria Summary

### 8 Criteria, 40 Points Maximum

| # | Criterion | Evaluates | Points |
|---|-----------|-----------|--------|
| 1 | Workflow Design | Architecture, error handling | /5 |
| 2 | Integration Quality | Tool connections, data flow | /5 |
| 3 | MCP Implementation | Configuration, practical use | /5 |
| 4 | Quality Systems | Evaluation, routing, review | /5 |
| 5 | Performance Monitoring | Logging, metrics, analysis | /5 |
| 6 | Documentation | Completeness, clarity | /5 |
| 7 | Practical Application | Real use, business value | /5 |
| 8 | Overall Value | Coherence, impact | /5 |

**Speaker Notes:**
Each criterion has detailed scoring descriptions in the participant guide. Participants should review each carefully and provide evidence for their self-assessment scores.

---

## Slide 5: Scoring Guide

### Performance Levels

| Score | Level | Meaning |
|-------|-------|---------|
| 34-40 | **Excellent** | Exceptional work, fully Block 3 ready |
| 28-33 | **Good** | Strong work, ready for Block 3 |
| 22-27 | **Adequate** | Meets requirements, can proceed |
| 16-21 | **Needs Work** | Gaps to address before Block 3 |
| 0-15 | **Incomplete** | Major work needed |

### Certification Threshold

**22 points minimum required for certification**

**Speaker Notes:**
Most participants land in the 28-35 range. The goal is honest self-assessment, not maximum scores. Below 22 requires revision before proceeding to Block 3.

---

## Slide 6: Self-Evaluation Tips

### How to Assess Honestly

**Do:**
- Provide specific evidence for each score
- Reference actual files and outputs
- Be realistic about gaps
- Note what you'd improve

**Don't:**
- Inflate scores without evidence
- Be overly harsh on yourself
- Skip criteria
- Rush through

### The Goal

Accurate self-assessment is a career skill.
Learning to evaluate your own work honestly makes you better.

**Speaker Notes:**
Self-evaluation accuracy matters more than high scores. Inflated scores without evidence are obvious. Honest assessment with evidence of growth is valued.

**BACKGROUND:**

**Rationale:**
- Self-evaluation is a critical professional skill that many participants have never practiced formally
- The slide establishes that honest self-assessment demonstrates maturity, not weakness
- Providing clear Do/Don't guidance removes ambiguity and anxiety about the evaluation process

**Key Research & Citations:**
- **Metacognitive Research**: Studies show that accurate self-assessment correlates with professional growth. Individuals who can honestly evaluate their work improve faster than those who inflate or deflate their abilities.
- **Growth Mindset Literature (Dweck)**: Honest acknowledgment of gaps is essential for improvement. Fixed mindset sees gaps as failures; growth mindset sees them as learning opportunities.
- **Professional Development Best Practices**: High-performing organizations emphasize self-assessment accuracy over score maximization in evaluation processes. Calibration (honest self-view) predicts future performance.

**Q&A Preparation:**
- *"What if I think I deserve a 5 but can't prove it?"*: Then it's probably a 4. The evidence requirement isn't arbitrary - it's what makes self-evaluation credible. If you can't show why it's excellent, reassess.
- *"Should I be harsh on myself to look modest?"*: No - be accurate. False modesty is as problematic as false confidence. If you met requirements well, give yourself a 4. If you exceeded them, give yourself a 5. Evidence supports both.
- *"What if I disagree with the rubric criteria?"*: Note your disagreement in reflection, but score against the stated criteria. Professional growth includes working within given frameworks, even when you'd design them differently.

## Slide 7: What You've Achieved

### Block 2 Accomplishments

| Capability | What You Built |
|------------|----------------|
| Workflow Design | 3 multi-step AI automations |
| Tool Integration | Connected platforms, APIs, outputs |
| MCP Proficiency | Configured AI tool access |
| Quality Systems | Automated evaluation + routing |
| Performance Monitoring | Tracking + optimization |
| Documentation | Handoff-ready materials |
| Impact Measurement | Quantified business value |

### The Transformation

**Block 1:** Individual AI interactions
**Block 2:** Automated, quality-controlled workflows

**Speaker Notes:**
This is a significant achievement. Participants have moved from manual AI use to systematic automation. Their toolkit will continue generating value.

**BACKGROUND:**

**Rationale:**
- This slide provides closure and recognition for substantial learning journey participants have completed
- It reframes accomplishments from discrete tasks to integrated capabilities - showing the bigger picture
- The transformation framing (Block 1 → Block 2) emphasizes skill progression and growth

**Key Research & Citations:**
- **Learning Journey Research**: Explicit recognition of progress strengthens intrinsic motivation and increases likelihood of continued learning. Celebrating milestones matters for sustained engagement.
- **Capability Building Literature**: Moving from tool use (Block 1) to system design (Block 2) represents a significant cognitive leap. This progression mirrors professional development from practitioner to architect.
- **Value Creation Measurement**: The toolkit participants built has real economic value - documented time savings, quality improvements, and automation capabilities that continue generating returns

**Q&A Preparation:**
- *"I didn't complete everything - should I still feel accomplished?"*: Progress is accomplishment. If you built even one working workflow with quality checks, that's substantial learning. Block 2 can always be revisited to complete remaining components.
- *"How do I know if I'm ready for Block 3?"*: Review prerequisites honestly. If you have working workflows, understand quality systems, and can configure MCP, you're ready. Block 3 builds on this foundation - you don't need perfection, just competency.
- *"What if I want to improve my Block 2 work before Block 3?"*: That's fine - Block 2 skills continue developing. But don't let perfectionism delay progression. Good enough to proceed is often better than perfect but delayed.

## Slide 8: Block 3 Preview

### Block 3: AI Automation Architecture

**What You'll Build:**
- Reliable AI agents with guardrails
- Multi-agent orchestration
- Production deployment systems
- Team-scale AI workflows

### The Progression

| Block | Focus | Outcome |
|-------|-------|---------|
| 1 | Prompt Engineering | AI brain |
| 2 | Workflow Automation | AI body |
| 3 | Agent Architecture | Autonomous systems |

### Everything Carries Forward

Block 2 workflows become Block 3 agent building blocks.

**Speaker Notes:**
Block 3 builds directly on Block 2. Workflows become components. MCP becomes agent tool access. Quality systems become guardrails. Completing Block 2 well sets up Block 3 success.
