---

## Slide 5: Scoring Guide

### Performance Levels

| Score | Level | Meaning |
|-------|-------|---------|
| 34-40 | **Excellent** | Exceptional work, fully Block 3 ready |
| 28-33 | **Good** | Strong work, ready for Block 3 |
| 22-27 | **Adequate** | Meets requirements, can proceed |
| 16-21 | **Needs Work** | Gaps to address before Block 3 |
| 0-15 | **Incomplete** | Major work needed |

### Certification Threshold

**22 points minimum required for certification**

**Speaker Notes:**
Most participants land in the 28-35 range. The goal is honest self-assessment, not maximum scores. Below 22 requires revision before proceeding to Block 3.

**BACKGROUND:**

**Rationale:**
- Clear scoring thresholds remove ambiguity about what constitutes successful completion
- The 22-point minimum (55%) represents competency - demonstrating fundamental capability without requiring perfection
- The distribution (28-35 typical) sets realistic expectations and reduces anxiety about achieving maximum scores

**Key Research & Citations:**
- **Competency-Based Assessment**: Research shows that minimum competency thresholds (50-60% of maximum) effectively distinguish capable practitioners from those needing additional development, while avoiding false precision of higher thresholds
- **Self-Assessment Calibration**: Studies of professional self-assessment show that clear rubrics with examples improve assessment accuracy by 40-60% compared to vague criteria
- **Certification Standards**: Professional certifications typically require 60-75% for passing. Block 2's 55% threshold acknowledges that this is foundational learning, not expert certification

**Q&A Preparation:**
- *"Why is 22/40 (55%) the passing threshold?"*: Block 2 is foundational - we're looking for competency, not mastery. 55% demonstrates you've built working systems and understand core concepts. Higher thresholds would require expertise that comes with practice beyond this program.
- *"What happens if I score below 22?"*: You'll receive specific feedback on gaps and opportunity to revise and resubmit. The goal is learning, not gatekeeping. Most revisions successfully achieve certification.
- *"Can I proceed to Block 3 with a score of 22-27?"*: Yes - that range indicates adequate competency. Block 3 will build on these foundations. A 22 means you've demonstrated minimum capability; a 27 means you're solidly competent.

## Slide 6: Self-Evaluation Tips

### How to Assess Honestly

**Do:**
- Provide specific evidence for each score
- Reference actual files and outputs
- Be realistic about gaps
- Note what you'd improve

**Don't:**
- Inflate scores without evidence
- Be overly harsh on yourself
- Skip criteria
- Rush through

### The Goal

Accurate self-assessment is a career skill.
Learning to evaluate your own work honestly makes you better.

**Speaker Notes:**
Self-evaluation accuracy matters more than high scores. Inflated scores without evidence are obvious. Honest assessment with evidence of growth is valued.

**BACKGROUND:**

**Rationale:**
- Self-evaluation is a critical professional skill that many participants have never practiced formally
- The slide establishes that honest self-assessment demonstrates maturity, not weakness
- Providing clear Do/Don't guidance removes ambiguity and anxiety about the evaluation process

**Key Research & Citations:**
- **Metacognitive Research**: Studies show that accurate self-assessment correlates with professional growth. Individuals who can honestly evaluate their work improve faster than those who inflate or deflate their abilities.
- **Growth Mindset Literature (Dweck)**: Honest acknowledgment of gaps is essential for improvement. Fixed mindset sees gaps as failures; growth mindset sees them as learning opportunities.
- **Professional Development Best Practices**: High-performing organizations emphasize self-assessment accuracy over score maximization in evaluation processes. Calibration (honest self-view) predicts future performance.

**Q&A Preparation:**
- *"What if I think I deserve a 5 but can't prove it?"*: Then it's probably a 4. The evidence requirement isn't arbitrary - it's what makes self-evaluation credible. If you can't show why it's excellent, reassess.
- *"Should I be harsh on myself to look modest?"*: No - be accurate. False modesty is as problematic as false confidence. If you met requirements well, give yourself a 4. If you exceeded them, give yourself a 5. Evidence supports both.
- *"What if I disagree with the rubric criteria?"*: Note your disagreement in reflection, but score against the stated criteria. Professional growth includes working within given frameworks, even when you'd design them differently.

## Slide 7: What You've Achieved

### Block 2 Accomplishments

| Capability | What You Built |
|------------|----------------|
| Workflow Design | 3 multi-step AI automations |
| Tool Integration | Connected platforms, APIs, outputs |
| MCP Proficiency | Configured AI tool access |
| Quality Systems | Automated evaluation + routing |
| Performance Monitoring | Tracking + optimization |
| Documentation | Handoff-ready materials |
| Impact Measurement | Quantified business value |

### The Transformation

**Block 1:** Individual AI interactions
**Block 2:** Automated, quality-controlled workflows

**Speaker Notes:**
This is a significant achievement. Participants have moved from manual AI use to systematic automation. Their toolkit will continue generating value.

**BACKGROUND:**

**Rationale:**
- This slide provides closure and recognition for substantial learning journey participants have completed
- It reframes accomplishments from discrete tasks to integrated capabilities - showing the bigger picture
- The transformation framing (Block 1 → Block 2) emphasizes skill progression and growth

**Key Research & Citations:**
- **Learning Journey Research**: Explicit recognition of progress strengthens intrinsic motivation and increases likelihood of continued learning. Celebrating milestones matters for sustained engagement.
- **Capability Building Literature**: Moving from tool use (Block 1) to system design (Block 2) represents a significant cognitive leap. This progression mirrors professional development from practitioner to architect.
- **Value Creation Measurement**: The toolkit participants built has real economic value - documented time savings, quality improvements, and automation capabilities that continue generating returns

**Q&A Preparation:**
- *"I didn't complete everything - should I still feel accomplished?"*: Progress is accomplishment. If you built even one working workflow with quality checks, that's substantial learning. Block 2 can always be revisited to complete remaining components.
- *"How do I know if I'm ready for Block 3?"*: Review prerequisites honestly. If you have working workflows, understand quality systems, and can configure MCP, you're ready. Block 3 builds on this foundation - you don't need perfection, just competency.
- *"What if I want to improve my Block 2 work before Block 3?"*: That's fine - Block 2 skills continue developing. But don't let perfectionism delay progression. Good enough to proceed is often better than perfect but delayed.

## Slide 8: Block 3 Preview

### Block 3: AI Automation Architecture

**What You'll Build:**
- Reliable AI agents with guardrails
- Multi-agent orchestration
- Production deployment systems
- Team-scale AI workflows

### The Progression

| Block | Focus | Outcome |
|-------|-------|---------|
| 1 | Prompt Engineering | AI brain |
| 2 | Workflow Automation | AI body |
| 3 | Agent Architecture | Autonomous systems |

### Everything Carries Forward

Block 2 workflows become Block 3 agent building blocks.

**Speaker Notes:**
Block 3 builds directly on Block 2. Workflows become components. MCP becomes agent tool access. Quality systems become guardrails. Completing Block 2 well sets up Block 3 success.

**BACKGROUND:**

**Rationale:**
- This preview motivates Block 2 completion by showing how skills carry forward - work done now pays dividends in Block 3
- The brain/body/autonomous progression provides a clear mental model for the three-block learning journey
- Framing workflows as "building blocks" reframes them from endpoints to foundations for more sophisticated systems

**Key Research & Citations:**
- **Scaffolded Learning Theory**: Learning progresses most effectively when new concepts build on mastered foundations. Block 3's agent architecture leverages Block 2's workflow competency rather than starting from scratch.
- **AI Agent Architecture Research**: Production AI agents require workflow orchestration, tool access (MCP), and quality guardrails - exactly what Block 2 develops. Agent capability is the integration of these components with autonomy.
- **Skill Transfer Literature**: When learners understand how current skills transfer to future applications, motivation and retention improve significantly. The "everything carries forward" framing activates this effect.

**Q&A Preparation:**
- *"Do I need to be perfect at Block 2 before starting Block 3?"*: No - you need competency (22+ points), not perfection. Block 3 will continue developing these skills while adding agent architecture. Strong foundation matters more than perfect execution.
- *"What if I'm not interested in autonomous agents?"*: Block 2 workflows are valuable standalone. But agent architecture skills (orchestration, guardrails, autonomy) are increasingly important professionally. Even if you don't build agents, understanding them matters for AI-enabled roles.
- *"Will Block 3 assume I've mastered everything in Block 2?"*: It assumes competency, not mastery. We'll review key concepts and build on them. Gaps that emerge can be addressed. The prerequisite ensures you're ready to learn agent concepts, not that you're an expert in workflows.

## Slide 9: Certification

### Upon Successful Completion (22+ points)

**You Have Demonstrated:**
- Multi-step AI workflow design
- Tool integration proficiency
- Quality system implementation
- Performance monitoring skills
- Documentation excellence
- Business impact measurement

### You Are Certified As:

## AI Workflow Engineer
*Block 2 Certified*

**Speaker Notes:**
Certification acknowledges demonstrated competency. This is a real accomplishment that can be shared professionally. It's a prerequisite for Block 3.

**BACKGROUND:**

**Rationale:**
- Certification provides tangible recognition of competency that participants can share professionally (LinkedIn, resume, internal profiles)
- The specific competencies listed translate directly to professional value - these are skills organizations need
- "AI Workflow Engineer" title positions participants as specialists in an emerging, high-value discipline

**Key Research & Citations:**
- **Professional Certification Value**: Studies show that specific, skill-based certifications increase employability and compensation by 10-20% in technology roles. Certifications demonstrate commitment and validated capability.
- **Micro-Credentials Research**: Shorter, focused certifications (like Block 2's 8-week program) are increasingly valued by employers as evidence of current, practical skills versus traditional degree programs
- **AI Skills Gap Research**: McKinsey reports that AI workflow engineering skills (automation design, quality systems, tool integration) are among the top 10 most in-demand skills for 2024-2026, with significant talent shortages

**Q&A Preparation:**
- *"How should I list this certification professionally?"*: LinkedIn: Add under Licenses & Certifications, title "AI Workflow Engineer - Block 2 Certified." Resume: Under Certifications or Professional Development, include date and issuing organization. Include link to capstone portfolio if public.
- *"Is this certification recognized by employers?"*: It's an emerging field - recognition grows as AI adoption increases. The portfolio (working workflows, documented impact) provides concrete evidence beyond the certification title. Demonstrated capability matters more than brand name.
- *"What's the difference between Block 2 and Block 3 certification?"*: Block 2 = AI Workflow Engineer (building automated workflows). Block 3 = AI Automation Architect (designing autonomous agent systems). Each builds on the previous, with increasing scope and autonomy.

### Appendix F: Common Self-Evaluation Mistakes

**Inflation Without Evidence:**
- Claiming "5" but only providing basic examples
- *Fix:* Match score to evidence. If evidence is basic, score is 3-4, not 5.

**Excessive Modesty:**
- Giving "2" when work clearly meets requirements
- *Fix:* If you met requirements with evidence, you've earned at least 3.

**Vague Evidence:**
- "My workflows work well" without specifics
- *Fix:* Provide concrete examples: "Workflow executed 47 times with 96% success rate"

**Missing Evidence:**
- Scoring without providing supporting links/examples
- *Fix:* Every score needs evidence. Link to files, provide examples, show results.

**Ignoring Gaps:**
- Scoring "4" while acknowledging major gaps
- *Fix:* Gaps reduce scores. Acknowledge them honestly and score accordingly.

**Comparing to Others:**
- "Mine isn't as good as X's work"
- *Fix:* Score against rubric, not peers. Different use cases = different complexity.
