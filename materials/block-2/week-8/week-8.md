## Self-Evaluation Questions

1. **Are my workflows production-ready?**
   - Would I trust them to run without supervision?
   - Have I tested edge cases and errors?
   - Is monitoring in place?

2. **Does my quality system actually improve output?**
   - Can I show before/after quality metrics?
   - Is human review systematic and efficient?
   - Do I learn from failures?

3. **Is MCP adding real value?**
   - Am I using it for practical purposes?
   - Is it integrated into workflows?
   - Could I demonstrate it to my team?

4. **What's my actual impact?**
   - Real time saved (not theoretical)
   - Real quality improvement
   - Real cost analysis

5. **What would I do differently?**
   - In workflow design?
   - In tool selection?
   - In quality systems?
   - What lessons will I carry to Block 3?
